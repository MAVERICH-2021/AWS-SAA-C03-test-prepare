Visual workflows for distributed applications

Step Functions is based on state machines and tasks. A state machine is a workflow. A task is a state in a workflow that represents a single unit of
work that another AWS service performs. Each step in a workflow is a state.
Depending on your use case, you can have Step Functions call AWS services, such as Lambda, to perform tasks.
