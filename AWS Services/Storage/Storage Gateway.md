AWS Storage Gateway is a service that connects an on-premises software appliance with cloud-based storage to provide seamless and secure
integration between an organization's on-premises IT environment and AWS's storage infrastructure. By deploying a file gateway as a virtual
machine on each clinic's premises, the medical research lab can provide low-latency access to the data stored in the S3 bucket while maintaining
read-only permissions for each clinic. This solution allows the clinics to access the data files directly from their on-premises file-based applications
without the need for data transfer or migration.
