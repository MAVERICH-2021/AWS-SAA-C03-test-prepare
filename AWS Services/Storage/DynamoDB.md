# DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX)

DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) is a ==caching service== designed to significantly improve the read performance of applications that use Amazon DynamoDB, an AWS-managed NoSQL database. 
DAX provides a fully managed, in-memory cache that can deliver response times in the microsecond range, which is much faster than the typical millisecond latency of standard DynamoDB queries. By caching data, DAX can offload some of the read load from DynamoDB, resulting in faster data retrieval and potentially reduced costs.

### **When Not to Use DAX**
While DAX offers advantages, it might not be the best fit for all use cases. DAX may not be beneficial in situations with:
   - High write-to-read ratios, as DAX mainly optimizes read operations.
   - Strong consistency requirements for reads since ==DAX only provides eventual consistency.==
   - Small or simple applications with low traffic, where the added cost and complexity of DAX might outweigh its benefits.
