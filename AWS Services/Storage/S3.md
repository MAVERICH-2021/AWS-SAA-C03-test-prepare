# Gateway endpoints

You can access Amazon S3 from your VPC using ==gateway endpoints==. After you create the gateway endpoint, you can add it as a target in your route table for traffic destined from your VPC to Amazon S3.

There is **no additional charge** for using gateway endpoints.

Amazon S3 supports both gateway endpoints and interface endpoints.

gateway endpoint:  
- access Amazon S3 from your VPC, without requiring an internet gateway or NAT device for your VPC, and with no additional cost. 
- do not allow access from on-premises networks, from peered VPCs in other AWS Regions, or through a transit gateway. For those scenarios, you must use an ==interface endpoint==, which is available for an additional cost. For more information, see Types of VPC endpoints for Amazon S3 in the Amazon S3 User Guide.

# Region & Replication

- **S3 Same-Region Replication (SRR)**
    
    Automatically replicates data between buckets in the same AWS region. You can use SRR to:  
    
    - Address data sovereignty and compliance requirements  
        
    - Protect data from accidental deletion  
        
    - Aggregate logs from different S3 buckets  
        
    
- **S3 Multi-Region Access Points**
    
    Automatically routes requests to the nearest S3 bucket over the AWS global network. This can improve application performance and reliability by avoiding congested network segments.  
    
- **Cross-Region Replication**
    
    Automatically copies objects between S3 buckets in different AWS regions. You can manage Cross-Region Replication settings using S3 Browser Freeware.  
    
- **Cross-region bucket access**
    
    Allows you to access a bucket without needing to know the bucket's region in advance. This feature is available in the AWS SDK for Java 2.0.
