With AWS CloudTrail, you can monitor your AWS deployments in the cloud by getting a ==history of AWS API calls== for your account, including API calls made by using the AWS Management Console, the AWS SDKs, the CLI, and higher-level AWS services. 

You can also identify which users and accounts called AWS APIs for services that support CloudTrail, the source IP address from which the calls were made, and when the calls occurred. 

You can integrate CloudTrail into applications using the API, automate trail creation for your organization, check the status of your trails, and control how administrators turn CloudTrail logging on and off.
