The company needs:
- A **highly available** solution.
- **Low-latency access to block storage** across multiple Availability Zones.
- **Minimal implementation effort**.

#### **Solution Analysis**:
1. **Option A**:
   - Uses **Amazon FSx for Windows File Server** as shared storage for two EC2 nodes in a cluster across two Availability Zones.
   - **Highly available** (since FSx can span multiple AZs).
   - **Minimal effort** since FSx is managed by AWS.
   - This option meets all the requirements.

2. **Option B**:
   - Uses **Amazon EBS** with application-level replication.
   - **Complex implementation** because the application must handle replication.
   - EBS volumes are **scoped to a single AZ**, so replication adds latency and complexity.

3. **Option C**:
   - Uses **FSx for NetApp ONTAP** with iSCSI access.
   - This is more complex to implement (iSCSI configuration adds overhead).
   - Not the best solution given the minimal implementation effort requirement.

4. **Option D**:
   - Uses **Amazon EBS io2 volumes** with **EBS-level replication**.
   - EBS replication across AZs is possible but relatively **new** and still involves complexities.
   - **Higher latency** compared to an FSx-based approach.

### Question #955
A company runs a web application on Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). The application stores data in an Amazon Aurora MySQL DB cluster.
The company needs to create a disaster recovery (DR) solution. The acceptable recovery time for the DR solution is up to 30 minutes. The DR solution does not need to support customer usage when the primary infrastructure is healthy.
Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Deploy the DR infrastructure in a second AWS Region with an ALB and an Auto Scaling group. Set the desired capacity and maximum
capacity of the Auto Scaling group to a minimum value. Convert the Aurora MySQL DB cluster to an Aurora global database. Configure
Amazon Route 53 for an active-passive failover with ALB endpoints.
B. Deploy the DR infrastructure in a second AWS Region with an ALUpdate the Auto Scaling group to include EC2 instances from the second
Region. Use Amazon Route 53 to configure active-active failover. Convert the Aurora MySQL DB cluster to an Aurora global database.
C. Back up the Aurora MySQL DB cluster data by using AWS Backup. Deploy the DR infrastructure in a second AWS Region with an ALB.
Update the Auto Scaling group to include EC2 instances from the second Region. Use Amazon Route 53 to configure active-active failover.
Create an Aurora MySQL DB cluster in the second Region Restore the data from the backup.
D. Back up the infrastructure configuration by using AWS Backup. Use the backup to create the required infrastructure in a second AWS
Region. Set the Auto Scaling group desired capacity to zero. Use Amazon Route 53 to configure active-passive failover. Convert the Aurora
MySQL DB cluster to an Aurora global database.
