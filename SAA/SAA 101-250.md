A solutions architect is designing a VPC with public and private subnets. The VPC and subnets use IPv4 CIDR blocks. There is one public subnet and one private subnet in each of three Availability Zones (AZs) for high availability. An internet gateway is used to provide internet access for the public subnets. The private subnets require access to the internet to allow Amazon EC2 instances to download software updates.  
What should the solutions architect do to enable Internet access for the private subnets?

- A. Create three NAT gateways, one for each public subnet in each AZ. Create a private route table for each AZ that forwards non-VPC traffic to the NAT gateway in its AZ.
- B. Create three NAT instances, one for each private subnet in each AZ. Create a private route table for each AZ that forwards non-VPC traffic to the NAT instance in its AZ.
- C. Create a second internet gateway on one of the private subnets. Update the route table for the private subnets that forward non-VPC traffic to the private internet gateway.
- D. Create an egress-only internet gateway on one of the public subnets. Update the route table for the private subnets that forward non-VPC traffic to the egress-only Internet gateway.

A company wants to migrate an on-premises data center to AWS. The data center hosts an SFTP server that stores its data on an NFS-based file system. The server holds 200 GB of data that needs to be transferred. The server must be hosted on an Amazon EC2 instance that uses an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system.  
Which combination of steps should a solutions architect take to automate this task? (Choose two.)

- A. Launch the EC2 instance into the same Availability Zone as the EFS file system.
- B. Install an AWS DataSync agent in the on-premises data center.
- C. Create a secondary Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume on the EC2 instance for the data.
- D. Manually use an operating system copy command to push the data to the EC2 instance.
- E. Use AWS DataSync to create a suitable location configuration for the on-premises SFTP server.


To automate the process of transferring the data from the on-premises SFTP server to an EC2 instance with an EFS file system, you can use AWS DataSync. AWS DataSync is a fully managed data transfer service that simplifies, automates, and accelerates transferring data between on-premises storage systems and Amazon S3, Amazon EFS, or Amazon FSx for Windows File Server.

To use AWS DataSync for this task, you should first install an AWS DataSync agent in the on-premises data center. This agent is a lightweight software application that you install on your on-premises data source. The agent communicates with the AWS DataSync service to transfer data between the data source and target locations.

A company has an AWS Glue extract, transform, and load (ETL) job that runs every day at the same time. The job processes XML data that is in an Amazon S3 bucket. New data is added to the S3 bucket every day. A solutions architect notices that AWS Glue is processing all the data during each run.  
What should the solutions architect do to prevent AWS Glue from reprocessing old data?

- A. Edit the job to use job bookmarks.
- B. Edit the job to delete data after the data is processed.
- C. Edit the job by setting the NumberOfWorkers field to 1.
- D. Use a FindMatches machine learning (ML) transform.

A
This is the purpose of bookmarks: "AWS Glue tracks data that has already been processed during a previous run of an ETL job by persisting state information from the job run. This persisted state information is called a job bookmark

### 107
A bicycle sharing company is developing a multi-tier architecture to track the location of its bicycles during peak operating hours. The company wants to use these data points in its existing analytics platform. A solutions architect must determine the most viable multi-tier option to support this architecture. The data points must be accessible from the REST API.  
Which action meets these requirements for storing and retrieving location data?

- A. Use Amazon Athena with Amazon S3.
- B. Use Amazon API Gateway with AWS Lambda.
- C. Use Amazon QuickSight with Amazon Redshift.
- D. Use Amazon API Gateway with Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics.

The correct answer is:

**D. Use Amazon API Gateway with Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics.**

Explanation:
Let’s analyze the requirements:

1. **Track real-time bicycle locations**: This suggests that the company needs a solution capable of ingesting, processing, and analyzing streaming data quickly.
2. **Multi-tier architecture**: This involves multiple layers, such as ingestion, processing, storage, and analytics.
3. **Data should be accessible from a REST API**: This means the solution should expose endpoints that allow access to data in near real-time for external applications or users.
4. **Integration with analytics platform**: Data points need to be continuously sent to an analytics system, indicating a preference for a service that supports streaming data with minimal latency.

**Option Analysis:**

- **A. Use Amazon Athena with Amazon S3**:  
   - **Athena** is a query engine used to analyze data stored in **S3**.  
   - This is not ideal for tracking real-time locations, as it is more suited for querying static, historical data.
   - It doesn’t support **real-time analytics or data streaming** directly.

- **B. Use Amazon API Gateway with AWS Lambda**:  
   - API Gateway with Lambda can provide a REST API interface, but Lambda functions are better suited for processing **event-based requests** rather than continuously streaming real-time data.
   - It wouldn’t handle high-frequency, real-time data ingestion and processing as efficiently as a **streaming solution** like Kinesis.

- **C. Use Amazon QuickSight with Amazon Redshift**:  
   - Redshift is a **data warehouse**, suitable for querying large datasets but **not designed for real-time data ingestion**.  
   - QuickSight is used for building **dashboards and visualizations**, not for tracking real-time locations.

- **D. Use Amazon API Gateway with Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics**:  
   - **API Gateway** can expose REST API endpoints for retrieving location data.
   - **Kinesis Data Analytics** can process the **real-time stream of location data** as it is ingested through **Kinesis Data Streams** or **Kinesis Firehose**.
   - This combination allows the company to perform **real-time analytics** and expose relevant insights through the REST API, which fits the requirements perfectly.

### 108

A company has an automobile sales website that stores its listings in a database on Amazon RDS. When an automobile is sold, the listing needs to be removed from the website and the data must be sent to multiple target systems.  
Which design should a solutions architect recommend?

- A. Create an AWS Lambda function triggered when the database on Amazon RDS is updated to send the information to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue for the targets to consume.
- B. Create an AWS Lambda function triggered when the database on Amazon RDS is updated to send the information to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) FIFO queue for the targets to consume.
- C. Subscribe to an RDS event notification and send an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue fanned out to multiple Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topics. Use AWS Lambda functions to update the targets.
- D. Subscribe to an RDS event notification and send an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic fanned out to multiple Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queues. Use AWS Lambda functions to update the targets.


The correct answer is:  A

---
**Explanation:**

The problem describes a **real-time trigger** system where:
1. **Database updates (listing removal) should trigger actions**.
2. **Multiple target systems** must receive the data.

 B
- A **FIFO queue** enforces strict ordering, which adds unnecessary complexity unless order is a strict requirement (not mentioned here).
- **Standard SQS** queues are typically preferred for decoupling with multiple consumers.

- **C. 
- This introduces **unnecessary complexity** by adding multiple SNS topics.  
- The direct use of SQS queues for each target is simpler and more appropriate.

- **D. 
- This approach relies on **RDS event notifications**, but these notifications are **limited** and may not trigger on all types of data changes.
- The **Lambda + SQS** design in Option A is a more **reliable and straightforward** way to trigger actions based on **data changes**.


### 109
A company needs to store data in Amazon S3 and must prevent the data from being changed. The company wants new objects that are uploaded to Amazon S3 to remain unchangeable for a nonspecific amount of time until the company decides to modify the objects. Only specific users in the company's AWS account can have the ability 10 delete the objects.  
What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?

- A. Create an S3 Glacier vault. Apply a write-once, read-many (WORM) vault lock policy to the objects.
- B. Create an S3 bucket with S3 Object Lock enabled. Enable versioning. Set a retention period of 100 years. Use governance mode as the S3 bucket’s default retention mode for new objects.
- C. Create an S3 bucket. Use AWS CloudTrail to track any S3 API events that modify the objects. Upon notification, restore the modified objects from any backup versions that the company has.
- D. Create an S3 bucket with S3 Object Lock enabled. Enable versioning. Add a legal hold to the objects. Add the s3:PutObjectLegalHold permission to the IAM policies of users who need to delete the objects.

retention period:
the length of time that information or records are kept, regardless of their format.

"The Object Lock legal hold operation enables you to place a legal hold on an object version. Like setting a retention period, a legal hold prevents an object version from being overwritten or deleted. However, a legal hold doesn't have an associated retention period and remains in effect until removed."

A social media company allows users to upload images to its website. The website runs on Amazon EC2 instances. During upload requests, the website resizes the images to a standard size and stores the resized images in Amazon S3. Users are experiencing slow upload requests to the website.  
The company needs to reduce coupling within the application and improve website performance. A solutions architect must design the most operationally efficient process for image uploads.  
Which combination of actions should the solutions architect take to meet these requirements? (Choose two.)

- A. Configure the application to upload images to S3 Glacier.
- B. Configure the web server to upload the original images to Amazon S3.
- C. Configure the application to upload images directly from each user's browser to Amazon S3 through the use of a presigned URL
- D. Configure S3 Event Notifications to invoke an AWS Lambda function when an image is uploaded. Use the function to resize the image.
- E. Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that invokes an AWS Lambda function on a schedule to resize uploaded images.


A user who does not have AWS credentials to upload a file can use a presigned URL to perform the upload. https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/s3-presigned-urls.html

Option B, Configuring the webserver to upload the original images to Amazon S3, is not a recommended solution as it would not reduce coupling within the application or improve performance.

A company hosts a containerized web application on a fleet of on-premises servers that process incoming requests. The number of requests is growing quickly. The on-premises servers cannot handle the increased number of requests. The company wants to move the application to AWS with minimum code changes and minimum development effort.  
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?

- A. Use AWS Fargate on Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) to run the containerized web application with Service Auto Scaling. Use an Application Load Balancer to distribute the incoming requests.
- B. Use two Amazon EC2 instances to host the containerized web application. Use an Application Load Balancer to distribute the incoming requests.
- C. Use AWS Lambda with a new code that uses one of the supported languages. Create multiple Lambda functions to support the load. Use Amazon API Gateway as an entry point to the Lambda functions.
- D. Use a high performance computing (HPC) solution such as AWS ParallelCluster to establish an HPC cluster that can process the incoming requests at the appropriate scale.

A company uses 50 TB of data for reporting. The company wants to move this data from on premises to AWS. A custom application in the company’s data center runs a weekly data transformation job. The company plans to pause the application until the data transfer is complete and needs to begin the transfer process as soon as possible.  
The data center does not have any available network bandwidth for additional workloads. A solutions architect must transfer the data and must configure the transformation job to continue to run in the AWS Cloud.  
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?

- A. Use AWS DataSync to move the data. Create a custom transformation job by using AWS Glue.
- B. Order an AWS Snowcone device to move the data. Deploy the transformation application to the device.
- C. Order an AWS Snowball Edge Storage Optimized device. Copy the data to the device. Create a custom transformation job by using AWS Glue.
- D. Order an AWS Snowball Edge Storage Optimized device that includes Amazon EC2 compute. Copy the data to the device. Create a new EC2 instance on AWS to run the transformation application.

AWS Snowcone
1. Deploy ultra-portable data transfer and edge computing devices anywhere
2. Collect and process data, transfer with AWS DataSync, or ship the device with data to AWS for offline transfer.


A. Use AWS DataSync to move the data. Create a custom transformation job by using AWS Glue. - No BW available for DataSync, so "asap" will be weeks/months (?)
B. Order an AWS Snowcone device to move the data. Deploy the transformation application to the device. - ==Snowcone will just store 14T==B (SSD configuration).
**C**. Order an AWS Snowball Edge Storage Optimized device. Copy the data to the device. Create a custom transformation job by using AWS Glue. - SnowBall can store 80TB (ok), takes around 1 week to move the device (faster than A), and AWS Glue allows to do ETL jobs. This is the answer.
D. Order an AWS Snowball Edge Storage Optimized device that includes Amazon EC2 compute. Copy the data to the device. Create a new EC2 instance on AWS to run the transformation application. - Same as C, but the ETL job requires the deployment/configuration/maintenance of an EC2 instance, while Glue is serverless. This means D has more operational overhead than C.

A global company is using Amazon API Gateway to design REST APIs for its loyalty club users in the us-east-1 Region and the ap-southeast-2 Region. A solutions architect must design a solution to protect these API Gateway managed REST APIs across multiple accounts from SQL injection and cross-site scripting attacks.  
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST amount of administrative effort?

- A. Set up AWS WAF in both Regions. Associate Regional web ACLs with an API stage.
- B. Set up AWS Firewall Manager in both Regions. Centrally configure AWS WAF rules.
- C. Set up AWS Shield in bath Regions. Associate Regional web ACLs with an API stage.
- D. Set up AWS Shield in one of the Regions. Associate Regional web ACLs with an API stage.
 **Option A: Set up AWS WAF in both Regions. Associate Regional web ACLs with an API stage.**

- **AWS WAF** is a **web application firewall** that protects web applications from security threats, including SQL injection and XSS.
- You need to configure **Regional web ACLs** because API Gateway is a **Regional service**.
- This solution aligns well with the requirement to protect REST APIs in **multiple regions** (us-east-1 and ap-southeast-2).
- Associating **web ACLs with API Gateway stages** ensures fine-grained protection at the API level.
- **Least administrative effort**: WAF rules are easy to set up, and AWS WAF has built-in managed rules for SQL injection and XSS attacks.

Thus, **this is the correct and most straightforward solution**.

 **Option B: Set up AWS Firewall Manager in both Regions. Centrally configure AWS WAF rules.**

- **AWS Firewall Manager** helps centrally manage firewall rules across multiple accounts and regions.
- While it simplifies rule management, it is more relevant for managing multiple security policies across **multiple AWS accounts** and services (like WAF, Shield, and Security Groups).
- For this scenario, the use of Firewall Manager introduces **unnecessary overhead**, as the primary goal is just API-level protection within a specific scope (multiple regions, not complex multi-account setups).

A company has implemented a self-managed DNS solution on three Amazon EC2 instances behind a Network Load Balancer (NLB) in the us-west-2 Region. Most of the company's users are located in the United States and Europe. The company wants to improve the performance and availability of the solution. The company launches and configures three EC2 instances in the eu-west-1 Region and adds the EC2 instances as targets for a new NLB.  
Which solution can the company use to route traffic to all the EC2 instances?

- A. Create an Amazon Route 53 geolocation routing policy to route requests to one of the two NLBs. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution. Use the Route 53 record as the distribution’s origin.
- B. Create a standard accelerator in AWS Global Accelerator. Create endpoint groups in us-west-2 and eu-west-1. Add the two NLBs as endpoints for the endpoint groups.
- C. Attach Elastic IP addresses to the six EC2 instances. Create an Amazon Route 53 geolocation routing policy to route requests to one of the six EC2 instances. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution. Use the Route 53 record as the distribution's origin.
- D. Replace the two NLBs with two Application Load Balancers (ALBs). Create an Amazon Route 53 latency routing policy to route requests to one of the two ALBs. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution. Use the Route 53 record as the distribution’s origin.

B is the correct one for self manage DNS If need to use Route53, ALB (layar 7 ) needs to be used as end points for 2 reginal x 3 EC2s, if it the case answer would be the option 4
Ans B - "AWS Global Accelerator improves the availability and performance of your applications for global users by routing traffic to the optimal endpoint based on performance and policies."


- **AWS Global Accelerator** provides **improved performance and availability** by directing users to the closest healthy endpoint (in this case, the Network Load Balancers in **us-west-2** and **eu-west-1**).
- Global Accelerator leverages **AWS’s global network**, which reduces latency and ensures traffic is routed through the most efficient paths.
- **Endpoint groups** in **Global Accelerator** allow the company to distribute traffic across NLBs in multiple regions, ensuring high availability.
- It also provides **failover capability**, sending traffic to the healthy region if one region becomes unavailable.

This solution aligns with the requirements to route traffic across multiple regions, while improving **performance** and **availability** for users in the US and Europe.

NLB 本身就是一个endPoint

the Domain Name System (DNS) uses TCP in addition to UDP: 
UDP is default: DNS uses UDP by default, but switches to TCP when UDP is unable to communicate. 

 **A. Route 53 geolocation routing policy + CloudFront distribution**

- **Geolocation routing** directs traffic based on the user’s location, but it does not consider **performance** or **availability** as effectively as Global Accelerator.
- CloudFront helps cache and distribute static content, but it doesn’t manage regional EC2 instances or load balancing directly.
- This approach doesn’t optimize real-time DNS performance for users in different regions as effectively as Global Accelerator.

 **C. Elastic IP addresses + Route 53 geolocation policy + CloudFront**

- Using **Elastic IPs for EC2 instances** directly is not scalable or reliable, as EC2 instances behind NLBs are more resilient.
- **Geolocation routing** won’t offer as dynamic and efficient routing as **Global Accelerator**.
- Again, CloudFront is useful for static content but does not enhance the performance of DNS-based traffic to EC2 instances.

 **D. Replace NLBs with ALBs + Route 53 latency routing policy + CloudFront**

- **Application Load Balancers (ALBs)** are optimized for HTTP/HTTPS traffic, but DNS services typically use **UDP or TCP**, which **NLBs** handle better.
- While **Route 53 latency routing** can help with performance, it lacks the **failover and traffic acceleration** capabilities that **Global Accelerator** offers.
- CloudFront isn't needed here since the focus is on optimizing DNS traffic, not delivering static content.

A company is running an online transaction processing (OLTP) workload on AWS. This workload uses an unencrypted Amazon RDS DB instance in a Multi-AZ deployment. Daily database snapshots are taken from this instance.  
What should a solutions architect do to ensure the database and snapshots are always encrypted moving forward?

- A. Encrypt a copy of the latest DB snapshot. Replace existing DB instance by restoring the encrypted snapshot.
- B. Create a new encrypted Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume and copy the snapshots to it. Enable encryption on the DB instance.
- C. Copy the snapshots and enable encryption using AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) Restore encrypted snapshot to an existing DB instance.
- D. Copy the snapshots to an Amazon S3 bucket that is encrypted using server-side encryption with AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) managed keys (SSE-KMS).

"You can enable encryption for an Amazon RDS DB instance when you create it, but not after it's created. However, you can add encryption to an unencrypted DB instance by creating a snapshot of your DB instance, and then creating an encrypted copy of that snapshot. You can then restore a DB instance from the encrypted snapshot to get an encrypted copy of your original DB instance."

- A. Create a new SSL certificate using AWS Certificate Manager (ACM). Install the ACM certificate on each instance.
- B. Create an Amazon S3 bucket Migrate the SSL certificate to the S3 bucket. Configure the EC2 instances to reference the bucket for SSL termination.
- C. Create another EC2 instance as a proxy server. Migrate the SSL certificate to the new instance and configure it to direct connections to the existing EC2 instances.
- D. Import the SSL certificate into AWS Certificate Manager (ACM). Create an Application Load Balancer with an HTTPS listener that uses the SSL certificate from ACM.

> **SSL termination** is the process of **decrypting incoming SSL/TLS traffic** at a load balancer, proxy server, or firewall, before passing it to backend servers in **plain text** (unencrypted).

D

This issue is solved by SSL offloading, i.e. by moving the SSL termination task to the ALB.

[AWS Elastic Load Balancing: Support for SSL Termination](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/elastic-load-balancer-support-for-ssl-termination/)

>You can now create a highly scalable, load-balanced web site using multiple Amazon EC2 instances, and you can easily arrange for the entire [HTTPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Secure) encryption and decryption process (generally known as SSL termination) to be handled by an [Elastic Load Balancer](http://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/). Your users can benefit from encrypted communication with very little operational overhead or administrative complexity.
>
>Until now, you had to handle the termination process within each EC2 instance. This added to the load on the instance and also required you to install an X.509 certificate on each instance. With this new release, you can simply upload the certificates to your AWS account and we’ll take care of getting them distributed to the load balancers.

A media company is evaluating the possibility of moving its systems to the AWS Cloud. The company needs at least 10 TB of storage with the maximum possible I/O performance for video processing, 300 TB of very durable storage for storing media content, and 900 TB of storage to meet requirements for archival media that is not in use anymore.  
Which set of services should a solutions architect recommend to meet these requirements?

- A. Amazon EBS for maximum performance, Amazon S3 for durable data storage, and Amazon S3 Glacier for archival storage
- B. Amazon EBS for maximum performance, Amazon EFS for durable data storage, and Amazon S3 Glacier for archival storage
- C. Amazon EC2 instance store for maximum performance, Amazon EFS for durable data storage, and Amazon S3 for archival storage
- D. Amazon EC2 instance store for maximum performance, Amazon S3 for durable data storage, and Amazon S3 Glacier for archival storage

instance store cannot be durable
THE CORRECT ANSWER IS A. The biggest Instance Store Storage Optimized option (is4gen.8xlarge) has a capacity of only 3TB. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-store-volumes.html#instance-store-vol-so

The correct Answer is A : Amazon EC2 instance store (Instance Store) is usually not the best choice because the storage it provides is temporary and tied to the life cycle of the instance. When an instance is stopped or terminated, data on the instance store is lost. In this scenario, the company's requirements were to have the maximum possible I/O performance and required durable data storage. Therefore, using Amazon EC2 Instance Store does not meet these requirements because it lacks durability. In contrast, Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store) provides persistent regional block storage and can meet the needs of high-performance I/O. Therefore, the answer should include Amazon EBS, not Amazon EC2 instance storage.

A company wants to move its application to a serverless solution. The serverless solution needs to analyze existing and new data by using SL. The company stores the data in an Amazon S3 bucket. The data requires encryption and must be replicated to a different AWS Region.  
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?

SL means: Supervised learning, 监督式机器学习

- A. Create a new S3 bucket. Load the data into the new S3 bucket. Use S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR) to replicate encrypted objects to an S3 bucket in another Region. Use server-side encryption with AWS KMS multi-Region kays (SSE-KMS). Use Amazon Athena to query the data.
- B. Create a new S3 bucket. Load the data into the new S3 bucket. Use S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR) to replicate encrypted objects to an S3 bucket in another Region. Use server-side encryption with AWS KMS multi-Region keys (SSE-KMS). Use Amazon RDS to query the data.
- C. Load the data into the existing S3 bucket. Use S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR) to replicate encrypted objects to an S3 bucket in another Region. Use server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). Use Amazon Athena to query the data.
- D. Load the data into the existing S3 bucket. Use S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR) to replicate encrypted objects to an S3 bucket in another Region. Use server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). Use Amazon RDS to query the data.

SSE-KMS vs SSE-S3 - The last seems to have less overhead (as the keys are automatically generated by S3 and applied on data at upload, and don't require further actions. KMS provides more flexibility, but in turn involves a different service, which finally is more "complex" than just managing one (S3). So A and B are excluded. If you are in doubt, you are having 2 buckets in A and B, while just keeping one in C and D.
https://s3browser.com/server-side-encryption-types.aspx
Decide between C and D is deciding on Athena or RDS. RDS is a relational db, and we have documents on S3, which is the use case for Athena. Athena is also serverless, which eliminates the need of controlling the underlying infrastructure and capacity. So

A company runs workloads on AWS. The company needs to connect to a service from an external provider. The service is hosted in the provider's VPC. According to the company’s security team, the connectivity must be private and must be restricted to the target service. The connection must be initiated only from the company’s VPC.  
Which solution will mast these requirements?

- A. Create a VPC peering connection between the company's VPC and the provider's VPC. Update the route table to connect to the target service.
- B. Ask the provider to create a virtual private gateway in its VPC. Use AWS PrivateLink to connect to the target service.
- C. Create a NAT gateway in a public subnet of the company’s VPUpdate the route table to connect to the target service.
- D. Ask the provider to create a VPC endpoint for the target service. Use AWS PrivateLink to connect to the target service.

B

**AWS PrivateLink provides private connectivity between VPCs, AWS services, and your on-premises networks, without exposing your traffic to the public internet**. AWS PrivateLink makes it easy to connect services across different accounts and VPCs to significantly simplify your network architecture. Interface **VPC endpoints**, powered by AWS PrivateLink, connect you to services hosted by AWS Partners and supported solutions available in AWS Marketplace. https://aws.amazon.com/privatelink/

By asking the provider to create a VPC endpoint for the target service, the company can use AWS PrivateLink to connect to the target service. This enables the company to access the service privately and securely over an Amazon VPC endpoint, without requiring a NAT gateway, VPN, or AWS Direct Connect. Additionally, this will restrict the connectivity only to the target service, as required by the company's security team.

Option A VPC peering connection may not meet security requirement as it can allow communication between all resources in both VPCs.
Option B, asking the provider to create a virtual private gateway in its VPC and use AWS PrivateLink to connect to the target service is not the optimal solution because it may require the provider to make changes and also you may face security issues.
Option C, creating a NAT gateway in a public subnet of the company’s VPC can expose the target service to the internet, which would not meet the security requirements.

A company uses AWS Organizations to create dedicated AWS accounts for each business unit to manage each business unit's account independently upon request. The root email recipient missed a notification that was sent to the root user email address of one account. The company wants to ensure that all future notifications are not missed. Future notifications must be limited to account administrators.  
Which solution will meet these requirements?

- A. Configure the company’s email server to forward notification email messages that are sent to the AWS account root user email address to all users in the organization.
- B. Configure all AWS account root user email addresses as distribution lists that go to a few administrators who can respond to alerts. Configure AWS account alternate contacts in the AWS Organizations console or programmatically.
- C. Configure all AWS account root user email messages to be sent to one administrator who is responsible for monitoring alerts and forwarding those alerts to the appropriate groups.
- D. Configure all existing AWS accounts and all newly created accounts to use the same root user email address. Configure AWS account alternate contacts in the AWS Organizations console or programmatically.

Option B ensures that all future notifications are not missed by configuring the AWS account root user email addresses as distribution lists that are monitored by a few administrators. By setting up alternate contacts in the AWS Organizations console or programmatically, the notifications can be sent to the appropriate administrators responsible for monitoring and responding to alerts. This solution allows for centralized management of notifications and ensures they are limited to account administrators.

A. Floods all users with notifications, lacks granularity.
C. Manual forwarding introduces delays, centralizes responsibility.
D. No flexibility for specific account administrators, limits customization.

A solutions architect needs to help a company optimize the cost of running an application on AWS. The application will use Amazon EC2 instances, AWS Fargate, and AWS Lambda for compute within the architecture.  
The EC2 instances will run the data ingestion layer of the application. EC2 usage will be **sporadic** and unpredictable. Workloads that run on EC2 instances can be interrupted at any time. The application front end will run on [[Fargate]] and Lambda will serve the API layer. The front-end utilization and API layer utilization will be predictable over the course of the next year.  
Which combination of purchasing options will provide the MOST cost-effective solution for hosting this application? (Choose two.)

- A. Use Spot Instances for the data ingestion layer
- B. Use On-Demand Instances for the data ingestion layer
- C. Purchase a ==1-year Compute Savings Plan for the front end and API layer.==  ( @Actionable )
- D. Purchase 1-year All Upfront Reserved instances for the data ingestion layer.
- E. Purchase a 1-year EC2 instance Savings Plan for the front end and API layer.

A (unpredictable-> demand / spot) (can be interupted -> spot)
C

**Sporadic** means something that happens **occasionally** or **irregularly**, without a consistent pattern or frequency. For example, "sporadic rain" refers to rain that occurs infrequently or unexpectedly.

Spot Instances provide the greatest savings for flexible, interruptible EC2 workloads like data ingestion.
Savings Plans offer significant discounts for predictable usage like the front end and API layer.

[[saving plan]]

AWS Spot Instances can provide savings of **up to 90%** compared to On-Demand EC2 instances. (@higher than saving plan 72%, so spot is most economic friendly)

Content is served over HTTPS through an API server running on an Amazon EC2 instance behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). The company wants the portal to provide this content to its users across the world as quickly as possible.
How should a solutions architect design the application to ensure the LEAST amount of latency for all users?

A. Deploy the application stack in a single AWS Region. Use [[CloudFront]] to serve all static and dynamic content by specifying the ALB
as an origin.
B. Deploy the application stack in two AWS Regions. Use an Amazon Route 53 latency routing policy to serve all content from the ALB in the
closest Region.
C. Deploy the application stack in a single AWS Region. Use Amazon CloudFront to serve the static content. Serve the dynamic content
directly from the ALB.
D. Deploy the application stack in two AWS Regions. Use an Amazon Route 53 geolocation routing policy to serve all content from the ALB in
the closest Region.

A company recently started using Amazon Aurora as the data store for its global ecommerce application. When large reports are run, developers report that the ecommerce application is performing poorly. After reviewing metrics in Amazon CloudWatch, a solutions architect finds that the ReadIOPS and CPUUtilizalion metrics are spiking when monthly reports run.
What is the MOST cost-effective solution?

A. Migrate the monthly reporting to Amazon Redshift.
B. Migrate the monthly reporting to an Aurora Replica.
C. Migrate the Aurora database to a larger instance class.
D. Increase the Provisioned IOPS on the Aurora instance.

Option A: Migrating the monthly reporting to [[Redshift]] may not be cost-effective because it involves creating a new data store and
potentially significant data migration and ETL costs

Option B: Migrating the monthly reporting to an Aurora Replica may be the most cost-effective solution because it involves creating a read-only
copy of the database that can be used specifically for running large reports without impacting the performance of the primary database. This
solution allows the company to scale the read capacity of the database without incurring additional hardware or I/O costs.

The analytics software, the web server that provides PHP, and the database server are all hosted on the EC2 instance. The application is showing signs of performance degradation during busy times and is presenting 5xx errors. The company needs to make the application scale seamlessly.
Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?

A. Migrate the database to an Amazon RDS for MySQL DB instance. Create an AMI of the web application. Use the AMI to launch a second EC2 On-Demand Instance. Use an Application Load Balancer to distribute the load to each EC2 instance.
B. Migrate the database to an Amazon RDS for MySQL DB instance. Create an AMI of the web application. Use the AMI to launch a second EC2 On-Demand Instance. Use Amazon Route 53 weighted routing to distribute the load across the two EC2 instances.
C. Migrate the database to an Amazon Aurora MySQL DB instance. Create an AWS Lambda function to stop the EC2 instance and change the
instance type. Create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm to invoke the Lambda function when CPU utilization surpasses 75%.
D. Migrate the database to an Amazon Aurora MySQL DB instance. Create an AMI of the web application. Apply the AMI to a launch template. Create an Auto Scaling group with the launch template Configure the launch template to use a Spot Fleet. Attach an Application Load Balancer
to the Auto Scaling group.

scale seamlessly => connot just add second EC2 / cannot just stop running EC2 then change its type then restart it

X: I wouldn't run my website on spot instances. Spot instances might be terminated at any time, and since I need to run analytics application it's not
an option for me. And using route 53 for load balancing of 2 instances is an overkill. I go with A.
R: It is spot fleet - not spot instances. They can include On-Demand instances and can also maintain the target capacity automatically.
A Spot Fleet is a set of Spot Instances and optionally On-Demand Instances that is launched based on criteria that you specify. The Spot Fleet
selects the Spot capacity pools that meet your needs and launches Spot Instances to meet the target capacity for the fleet. By default, Spot
Fleets are set to maintain target capacity by launching replacement instances after Spot Instances in the fleet are terminated.

### 150
A company is migrating an application from on-premises servers to Amazon EC2 instances. As part of the migration design requirements, a solutions architect must implement infrastructure metric alarms. The company does not need to take action if CPU utilization increases to more than 50% for a short burst of time. However, if the CPU utilization ncreases to more than 50% and read IOPS on the disk are high at the same time, the company needs to act as soon as possible. The solutions architect also must reduce false alarms.
What should the solutions architect do to meet these requirements?

A. Create Amazon CloudWatch composite alarms where possible.
B. Create Amazon CloudWatch dashboards to visualize the metrics and react to issues quickly.
C. Create Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics canaries to monitor the application and raise an alarm.
D. Create single Amazon CloudWatch metric alarms with multiple metric thresholds where possible.

use composite alarms to reduce alarm noise
By creating composite alarms in CloudWatch, the solutions architect can combine multiple metrics, such as CPU utilization and read IOPS, into a
single alarm. This allows the company to take action only when both conditions are met, reducing false alarms and focusing on meaningful alerts

CloudWatch Synthetics canaries is useful for actively monitoring the application's behavior and availability.

### 159
A company is running a publicly accessible serverless application that uses [[API Gateway]] and AWS Lambda. The application’s traffic recently spiked due to fraudulent requests from botnets. 
Which steps should a solutions architect take to block requests from unauthorized users? (Choose two.)
A. Create a usage plan with an API key that is shared with genuine users only.
B. Integrate logic within the Lambda function to ignore the requests from fraudulent IP addresses.
C. Implement an AWS WAF rule to target malicious requests and trigger actions to filter them out.
D. Convert the existing public API to a private API. Update the DNS records to redirect users to the new API endpoint.
E. Create an IAM role for each user attempting to access the API. A user will assume the role when making the API call.

A C 
A 
- API Gateway can **generate and manage API keys** to control **who can access the API**.
- An **API key** is a unique string that identifies authorized users and helps **throttle or rate-limit** their requests via a **usage plan**.

B) no possible for a  publicly accessible application to handle dynamic IP of bots
C) WAF has bot identification and remedial tools, so it's CORRECT.

**Why option E is problematic**:
- **IAM roles** are designed for managing **permissions** between AWS services or users within AWS, not for managing public access to APIs.
- **End-users (e.g., mobile app or web app users)** don’t typically assume IAM roles when making API calls. Instead, API Gateway manages public access with **API keys, Cognito, or IAM policies**.
- Implementing this approach would **require complex user management** and is **impractical** for large public-facing applications.

### 164
A company has two applications: a sender application that sends messages with payloads to be processed and a processing application intended to receive the messages with payloads. The company wants to implement an AWS service to handle messages between the two applications. The sender application can send about 1,000 messages each hour. The messages may take up to 2 days to be processed: If the messages fail to process, they must be retained so that they do not impact the processing of any remaining messages.
Which solution meets these requirements and is the MOST operationally efficient?
A. Set up an Amazon EC2 instance running a Redis database. Configure both applications to use the instance. Store, process, and delete the
messages, respectively.
B. Use an [[Kinesis]] data stream to receive the messages from the sender application. Integrate the processing application with the
Kinesis Client Library (KCL).
C. Integrate the sender and processor applications with an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Configure a dead-letter queue to collect the messages that failed to process.
D. Subscribe the processing application to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic to receive notifications to process. Integrate the sender application to write to the SNS topic.

C

A) Not operationally efficient
B) Kinesis is for real-time processing
D) SNS is not suitable for work queuing.

### 165
A solutions architect must design a solution that uses Amazon CloudFront with an Amazon S3 origin to store a static website. The company’s security policy requires that all website traffic be inspected by [[WAF]].
How should the solutions architect comply with these requirements?
A. Configure an S3 bucket policy to accept requests coming from the AWS WAF Amazon Resource Name (ARN) only.
B. Configure Amazon CloudFront to forward all incoming requests to AWS WAF before requesting content from the S3 origin.
C. Configure a security group that allows Amazon CloudFront IP addresses to access Amazon S3 only. Associate AWS WAF to CloudFront.
D. Configure Amazon CloudFront and Amazon S3 to use an origin access identity (OAI) to restrict access to the S3 bucket. Enable AWS WAF on the distribution.

D
**Restricting Access to the S3 Bucket**:
- Using an **Origin Access Identity (OAI)** ensures that only CloudFront can access the S3 bucket directly. This means users can’t bypass CloudFront (and therefore AWS WAF) to access the S3 content directly.
**Enabling AWS WAF on CloudFront**:
- **AWS WAF** can be enabled directly on the CloudFront distribution. When requests come through CloudFront, they are inspected by AWS WAF before reaching the S3 bucket.

OAI

Integrate [[WAF]] to prevent direct access to origin
https://aws.amazon.com/jp/blogs/security/how-to-enhance-amazon-cloudfront-origin-security-with-aws-waf-and-aws-secrets-manager/

why B wrong:
CloudFront does not “forward” requests to AWS WAF; instead, AWS WAF is applied directly on the CloudFront distribution. So this option is not feasible.

### 166
Organizers for a global event want to put daily reports online as static HTML pages. The pages are expected to generate millions of views from users around the world. The files are stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. A solutions architect has been asked to design an efficient and effective solution.

### 168
A security team wants to limit access to specific services or actions in all of the team’s AWS accounts. All accounts belong to a large organization in AWS Organizations. The solution must be scalable and there must be a single point where permissions can be maintained. 
What should a solutions architect do to accomplish this?
A. Create an ACL to provide access to the services or actions.
B. Create a security group to allow accounts and attach it to user groups.
C. Create cross-account roles in each account to deny access to the services or actions.
D. Create a service control policy in the root organizational unit to deny access to the services or actions.

D

D. Service control policies (SCPs) are one type of policy that you can use to manage your organization. SCPs offer central control over the maximum available permissions for all accounts in your organization, allowing you to ensure your accounts stay within your organization's access control guidelines.

### 169
A company is concerned about the security of its public web application due to recent web attacks. The application uses an Application Load Balancer (ALB). A solutions architect must reduce the risk of DDoS attacks against the application.
What should the solutions architect do to meet this requirement?
A. Add an [[Inspector]] agent to the ALB.
B. Configure [[Macie]] to prevent attacks.
C. Enable AWS Shield Advanced to prevent attacks.
D. Configure [[GuardDuty]] to monitor the ALB.

C
When you see DDOS immediately think Shield
### 170
A company’s web application is running on Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer. The company recently changed its policy, which now requires the application to be accessed from one specific country only.
Which configuration will meet this requirement?
A. Configure the security group for the EC2 instances.
B. Configure the security group on the Application Load Balancer.
C. Configure [[WAF]] on the Application Load Balancer in a VPC.
D. Configure the network ACL for the subnet that contains the EC2 instances.

C

Geographic (Geo) Match Conditions in AWS WAF. This new condition type allows you to use AWS WAF to restrict application access based on the
geographic location of your viewers. With geo match conditions you can choose the countries from which AWS WAF should allow access.
https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/10/aws-waf-now-supports-geographic-match/

[[Network ACL]]s primarily control traffic at the subnet level based on IP
addresses and port numbers, but they do not have built-in capabilities for country-based filtering.

### 171
A company provides an API to its users that automates inquiries for tax computations based on item prices. The company experiences a larger
number of inquiries during the holiday season only that cause slower response times. A solutions architect needs to design a solution that is
scalable and elastic.
What should the solutions architect do to accomplish this?
A. Provide an API hosted on an Amazon EC2 instance. The EC2 instance performs the required computations when the API request is made.
B. Design a REST API using Amazon API Gateway that accepts the item names. API Gateway passes item names to AWS Lambda for tax
computations.
C. Create an Application Load Balancer that has two Amazon EC2 instances behind it. The EC2 instances will compute the tax on the received
item names.
D. Design a REST API using Amazon API Gateway that connects with an API hosted on an Amazon EC2 instance. API Gateway accepts and
passes the item names to the EC2 instance for tax computations.

B

Option D is similar to option B in that it uses Amazon API Gateway to handle the API requests, but it also includes an EC2 instance to perform the tax computations. However, using an EC2 instance in this way is less scalable and less elastic than using AWS Lambda to perform the computations An EC2 instance is a fixed resource and requires manual scaling and management, while Lambda is an event-driven, serverless compute service tha automatically scales with the number of requests, making it more suitable for handling variable workloads and reducing response times during high traffic periods. Additionally, Lambda is more cost-efficient than EC2 instances, as you only pay for the compute time consumed by your functions, making it a more cost-effective solution.

### 172
A solutions architect is creating a new Amazon CloudFront distribution for an application. Some of the information submitted by users is sensitive. The application uses HTTPS but needs another layer of security. The sensitive information should.be protected throughout the entire application stack, and access to the information should be restricted to certain applications.
Which action should the solutions architect take?
A. Configure a [[CloudFront]] signed URL.
B. Configure a CloudFront signed cookie.
C. Configure a CloudFront field-level encryption profile.
D. Configure CloudFront and set the Origin Protocol Policy setting to HTTPS Only for the Viewer Protocol Policy.
[[CloudFront#signed URLs & signed cookies]]

C

Field-level encryption allows you to enable your users to securely upload sensitive information to your web servers. The sensitive information provided by your users is encrypted at the edge, close to the user, and remains encrypted throughout your entire application stack. This  encryption ensures that only applications that need the data—and have the credentials to decrypt it—are able to do so.

### 173
A gaming company hosts a browser-based application on AWS. The users of the application consume a large number of videos and images that are stored in Amazon S3. This content is the same for all users.
The application has increased in popularity, and millions of users worldwide accessing these media files. The company wants to provide the files to the users while reducing the load on the origin.
Which solution meets these requirements MOST cost-effectively?
A. Deploy an AWS Global Accelerator accelerator in front of the web servers.
B. Deploy an Amazon CloudFront web distribution in front of the S3 bucket.
C. Deploy an Amazon ElastiCache for Redis instance in front of the web servers.
D. Deploy an Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached instance in front of the web servers.

B

B. Cloud front is best for content delivery. Global Accelerator is best for non-HTTP (TCP/UDP) cases and supports HTTP cases as well but with static IP (elastic IP) or anycast IP address only.

### 174
A company has a multi-tier application that runs six front-end web servers in an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group in a single Availability Zone behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). A solutions architect needs to modify the infrastructure to be highly available without modifying the application.
Which architecture should the solutions architect choose that provides high availability?
A. Create an Auto Scaling group that uses three instances across each of two Regions.
B. Modify the Auto Scaling group to use three instances across each of two Availability Zones.
C. Create an Auto Scaling template that can be used to quickly create more instances in another Region.
D. Change the ALB in front of the Amazon EC2 instances in a [[Round-robin load balancing]] configuration to balance traffic to the web tier.

B
auto scaling groups can not span multi region

### 175
An ecommerce company has an order-processing application that uses Amazon API Gateway and an AWS Lambda function. The application stores data in an Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL database. During a recent sales event, a sudden surge in customer orders occurred. Some customers experienced timeouts, and the application did not process the orders of those customers.
A solutions architect determined that the CPU utilization and memory utilization were high on the database because of a large number of open connections. The solutions architect needs to prevent the timeout errors while making the least possible changes to the application.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A. Configure provisioned concurrency for the Lambda function. Modify the database to be a global database in multiple AWS Regions.
B. Use Amazon RDS Proxy to create a proxy for the database. Modify the Lambda function to use the RDS Proxy endpoint instead of the database endpoint.
C. Create a read replica for the database in a different AWS Region. Use query string parameters in API Gateway to route traffic to the read replica.
D. Migrate the data from Aurora PostgreSQL to Amazon DynamoDB by using AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS). Modify the Lambda function to use the DynamoDB table.

Many applications, including those built on modern serverless architectures, can have a large number of open connections to the database server and may open and close database connections at a high rate, exhausting database memory and compute resources. Amazon RDS Proxy allows applications to pool and share connections established with the database, improving database efficiency and application scalability.

### 177
An entertainment company is using Amazon DynamoDB to store media metadata. The application is read intensive and experiencing delays. The company does not have staff to handle additional operational overhead and needs to improve the performance efficiency of DynamoDB without reconfiguring the application.
What should a solutions architect recommend to meet this requirement?
A. Use Amazon ElastiCache for Redis.
B. Use Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX).
C. Replicate data by using DynamoDB global tables.
D. Use Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached with Auto Discovery enabled.

DAX stands for DynamoDB Accelerator, and it's like a turbo boost for your DynamoDB tables. It's a fully managed, in-memory cache that speeds up
the read and write performance of your DynamoDB tables, so you can get your data faster than ever before.

A solutions architect needs to securely store a database user name and password that an application uses to access an Amazon RDS DB instance. The application that accesses the database runs on an Amazon EC2 instance. The solutions architect wants to create a secure parameter in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store.
What should the solutions architect do to meet this requirement?
A. Create an IAM role that has read access to the Parameter Store parameter. Allow Decrypt access to an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key that is used to encrypt the parameter. Assign this IAM role to the EC2 instance.
B. Create an IAM policy that allows read access to the Parameter Store parameter. Allow Decrypt access to an AWS Key Management Service
(AWS KMS) key that is used to encrypt the parameter. Assign this IAM policy to the EC2 instance.
C. Create an IAM trust relationship between the Parameter Store parameter and the EC2 instance. Specify Amazon RDS as a principal in the
trust policy.
D. Create an IAM trust relationship between the DB instance and the EC2 instance. Specify Systems Manager as a principal in the trust policy.

IAM trust relationships are created between **IAM roles and principals**, not between individual AWS services or specific resources like Parameter Store parameters.

A
To securely store a database user name and password in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store and allow an application running on an EC2 instance to access it, the solutions architect should create an IAM role that has read access to the Parameter Store parameter and allow Decrypt access to an AWS KMS key that is used to encrypt the parameter. The solutions architect should then assign this IAM role to the EC2 instance.
This approach allows the EC2 instance to access the parameter in the Parameter Store and decrypt it using the specified KMS key while enforcing the necessary security controls to ensure that the parameter is only accessible to authorized parties.

Option B, would not be sufficient, as IAM policies cannot be directly attached to EC2 instances

An **AWS Trust Policy** is a JSON document attached to an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that defines _who (which entities)_ can assume or access that role. Essentially, it specifies _trust relationships_ by listing the AWS accounts, services, or users that are allowed to assume the role and perform actions on resources.
- **Cross-account access**: Allowing roles in one account to access resources in another account.
- **Service roles**: Allowing AWS services (like Lambda, EC2) to assume roles with specific permissions.

A company is designing a cloud communications platform that is driven by APIs. The application is hosted on Amazon EC2 instances behind a Network Load Balancer (NLB). The company uses Amazon API Gateway to provide external users with access to the application through APIs. The company wants to protect the platform against web exploits like SQL injection and also wants to detect and mitigate large, sophisticated DDoS attacks.
Which combination of solutions provides the MOST protection? (Choose two.)
A. Use [[WAF]] to protect the NLB.
B. Use [[Shield]] Advanced with the NLB.
C. Use AWS WAF to protect Amazon API Gateway.
D. Use Amazon GuardDuty with AWS Shield Standard
E. Use AWS Shield Standard with Amazon API Gateway.

B C
- Shield - EC2, ELB, Amazon CloudFront, AWS Global Accelerator, and Route 53.

- WAF - Amazon CloudFront, ALB, Amazon API Gateway, and AWS AppSync
**AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall)** can be used to protect API Gateway from web exploits such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other Layer 7 attacks.
**AWS Shield Advanced** provides comprehensive DDoS protection, including sophisticated, large-scale attacks. It protects against common DDoS attacks at both the network (Layer 3) and transport (Layer 4) layers.
### 181
A company has a legacy data processing application that runs on Amazon EC2 instances. Data is processed sequentially, but the order of results does not matter. The application uses a monolithic architecture. The only way that the company can scale the application to meet increased demand is to increase the size of the instances.
The company’s developers have decided to rewrite the application to use a microservices architecture on Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS).
What should a solutions architect recommend for communication between the microservices?
A. Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Add code to the data producers, and send data to the queue. Add code to
the data consumers to process data from the queue.
B. Create an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic. Add code to the data producers, and publish notifications to the topic. Add code to the data consumers to subscribe to the topic.
C. Create an AWS Lambda function to pass messages. Add code to the data producers to call the Lambda function with a data object. Add code to the data consumers to receive a data object that is passed from the Lambda function.
D. Create an Amazon DynamoDB table. Enable DynamoDB Streams. Add code to the data producers to insert data into the table. Add code to the data consumers to use the DynamoDB Streams API to detect new table entries and retrieve the data.

A
SQS 可以设计单次接收消息数

SNS is a pub/sub messaging service that is designed for one-to-many communication, rather than point-to-point communication between specific microservices. multiple subscribers receive the same message.

using an AWS Lambda function to pass messages, would not be suitable for this use case, as it would require the data producers and
data consumers to have a direct connection and invoke the Lambda function, rather than being decoupled through a message queue.

using an Amazon DynamoDB table with DynamoDB Streams, would not be suitable for this use case, as it would require the data
consumers to continuously poll the DynamoDB Streams API to detect new table entries, rather than being notified of new data through a message
queue.

A company wants to migrate its MySQL database from on premises to AWS. The company recently experienced a database outage that significantly impacted the business. To ensure this does not happen again, the company wants a reliable database solution on AWS that minimizes data loss and stores every transaction on at least two nodes.
Which solution meets these requirements?

A. Create an Amazon RDS DB instance with ==synchronous replication== to three nodes in three Availability Zones.
B. Create an Amazon RDS MySQL DB instance with Multi-AZ functionality enabled to synchronously replicate the data.
C. Create an Amazon RDS MySQL DB instance and then create a read replica in a separate AWS Region that synchronously replicates the data.
D. Create an Amazon EC2 instance with a MySQL engine installed that triggers an AWS Lambda function to synchronously replicate the data to an Amazon RDS MySQL DB instance.

B

Read Replica always asynchronous. so option C is ignored.
RDS Multi-AZ = Synchronous = Disaster Recovery (DR)
Read Replica = Asynchronous = High Availability
### 183
A company is building a new dynamic ordering website. The company wants to minimize server maintenance and patching. The website must be highly available and must scale read and write capacity as quickly as possible to meet changes in user demand.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A. Host static content in Amazon S3. Host dynamic content by using Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda. Use Amazon DynamoDB with on-demand capacity for the database. Configure Amazon CloudFront to deliver the website content.
B. Host static content in Amazon S3. Host dynamic content by using Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda. Use Amazon Aurora with Aurora Auto Scaling for the database. Configure Amazon CloudFront to deliver the website content.
C. Host all the website content on Amazon EC2 instances. Create an Auto Scaling group to scale the EC2 instances. Use an Application Load
Balancer to distribute traffic. Use Amazon DynamoDB with provisioned write capacity for the database.
D. Host all the website content on Amazon EC2 instances. Create an Auto Scaling group to scale the EC2 instances. Use an Application Load
Balancer to distribute traffic. Use Amazon Aurora with Aurora Auto Scaling for the database.

A - is correct, because Dynamodb on-demand scales write and read capacity

B - Aurora auto scaling scales only read replicas

A company has an AWS account used for software engineering. The AWS account has access to the company’s on-premises data center through a pair of AWS Direct Connect connections. All non-VPC traffic routes to the [[virtual private gateway]].
A development team recently created an AWS Lambda function through the console. The development team needs to allow the function to access a database that runs in a private subnet in the company’s data center.
Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Configure the Lambda function to run in the VPC with the appropriate security group.
B. Set up a VPN connection from AWS to the data center. Route the traffic from the Lambda function through the VPN.
C. Update the route tables in the VPC to allow the Lambda function to access the on-premises data center through Direct Connect.
D. Create an Elastic IP address. Configure the Lambda function to send traffic through the Elastic IP address without an [[elastic network interface]].

To configure a VPC for an existing function:
1. Open the Functions page of the Lambda console.
2. Choose a function.
3. Choose Configuration and then choose VPC.
4. Under VPC, choose Edit.
5. Choose a VPC, subnets, and security groups. <-- **That's why I believe the answer is A**.
Note:
If your function needs internet access, use network address translation (NAT). Connecting a function to a public subnet doesn't give it internet
access or a public IP address.

C is not correct at all as in the question it metions that the VPC already has connectivity with on-premises, No need to do route updates. This is because the route to the destination on-premises is already set.
### 185
A company runs an application using Amazon ECS. The application creates resized versions of an original image and then makes Amazon S3 API calls to store the resized images in Amazon S3.
How can a solutions architect ensure that the application has permission to access Amazon S3?
A. Update the S3 role in AWS IAM to allow read/write access from Amazon ECS, and then relaunch the container.
B. Create an IAM role with S3 permissions, and then specify that role as the taskRoleArn in the task definition.
C. Create a [[security group]] that allows access from Amazon ECS to Amazon S3, and update the launch configuration used by the ECS cluster.
D. Create an IAM user with S3 permissions, and then relaunch the Amazon EC2 instances for the ECS cluster while logged in as this account.

### 186
A company has a Windows-based application that must be migrated to AWS. The application requires the use of a shared Windows file system attached to multiple Amazon EC2 Windows instances that are deployed across multiple Availability Zone:
What should a solutions architect do to meet this requirement?
A. Configure AWS Storage Gateway in volume gateway mode. Mount the volume to each Windows instance.
B. Configure [[FSx]] for Windows File Server. Mount the Amazon FSx file system to each Windows instance.
C. Configure a file system by using [[Elastic File System (EFS)]] (Amazon EFS). Mount the EFS file system to each Windows instance.
D. Configure an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume with the required size. Attach each EC2 instance to the volume. Mount the
file system within the volume to each Windows instance.
B
FSx --> shared Windows file system（SMB）
EFS --> Linux NFS

Option B: Configure Amazon FSx for Windows File Server. This service provides a fully managed Windows file system that can be easily shared
across multiple EC2 Windows instances. It offers high performance and supports Windows applications that require file storage.
Option C is incorrect because while Amazon EFS can be mounted to multiple instances, it is a Linux-based file system and may not be suitable for
Windows applications.
Option D is incorrect because attaching and mounting an Amazon EBS volume to multiple instances simultaneously is not supported.

A company needs to store contract documents. A contract lasts for 5 years. During the 5-year period, the company must ensure that the
documents cannot be overwritten or deleted. The company needs to encrypt the documents at rest and rotate the encryption keys automatically every year.
Which combination of steps should a solutions architect take to meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead? (Choose two.)
A. Store the documents in Amazon S3. Use S3 Object Lock in governance mode.
B. Store the documents in Amazon S3. Use S3 Object Lock in compliance mode.
C. Use server-side encryption with [[S3]] managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). Configure key rotation.
D. Use server-side encryption with AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer managed keys. Configure key rotation.
E. Use server-side encryption with AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer provided (imported) keys. Configure key rotation.
> B D

1. **Amazon S3 Object Lock in Compliance Mode (Option B)**:
    - S3 Object Lock in **compliance mode** ensures that documents cannot be overwritten or deleted for a specified retention period. This mode is typically used to meet regulatory requirements, as it prevents anyone (including the root account) from modifying or deleting the objects during the specified retention period. This directly aligns with the requirement for the documents to be immutable for 5 years.
    - ==**Governance mode** (Option A) would allow authorized users to bypass the lock==, which doesn't fully meet the company's requirement of preventing deletion or modification.
2. **AWS KMS Customer Managed Keys (CMK) with Key Rotation (Option D)**:
    - **Server-side encryption with AWS KMS CMKs** provides encryption at rest with managed encryption keys that can automatically rotate annually, aligning with the requirement for yearly key rotation.
    - AWS KMS customer managed keys (CMKs) offer more flexibility, control, and automated key rotation compared to Amazon S3-managed encryption keys (SSE-S3) or customer-provided (imported) keys. Using KMS CMKs minimizes operational overhead because AWS handles the rotation automatically without manual intervention.
Using **AWS KMS Customer Provided Keys (CPKs)** (Option E) is not ideal in this scenario because it would **increase operational overhead** and **complicate key management** compared to using AWS KMS Customer Managed Keys (CMKs).
KMS CMKs 中的managed意思是交给AWS管理 (和managed service同理)

Timeouts are occurring during order processing because the reporting queries are taking a long time to run. The company needs to eliminate the timeouts without preventing employees from performing queries.
What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?
A. Create a read replica. Move reporting queries to the read replica.
B. Create a read replica. Distribute the ordering application to the primary DB instance and the read replica.
C. Migrate the ordering application to Amazon DynamoDB with on-demand capacity.
D. Schedule the reporting queries for non-peak hours.

A hospital wants to create digital copies for its large collection of historical written records. The hospital will continue to add hundreds of new documents each day. The hospital’s data team will scan the documents and will upload the documents to the AWS Cloud.
A solutions architect must implement a solution to analyze the documents, extract the medical information, and store the documents so that an application can run SQL queries on the data. The solution must maximize scalability and operational efficiency.
Which combination of steps should the solutions architect take to meet these requirements? (Choose two.)
A. Write the document information to an Amazon EC2 instance that runs a MySQL database.
B. Write the document information to an Amazon S3 bucket. Use Amazon Athena to query the data.
C. Create an Auto Scaling group of Amazon EC2 instances to run a custom application that processes the scanned files and extracts the
medical information.
D. Create an AWS Lambda function that runs when new documents are uploaded. Use [[Rekognition]] to convert the documents to raw
text. Use [[Transcribe#Medical]] to detect and extract relevant medical information from the text.
E. Create an AWS Lambda function that runs when new documents are uploaded. Use [[Textract]] to convert the documents to raw text.

### 193
A company is running a batch application on Amazon EC2 instances. The application consists of a backend with multiple Amazon RDS databases. The application is causing a high number of reads on the databases. A solutions architect must reduce the number of database reads while ensuring high availability.
What should the solutions architect do to meet this requirement?
A. Add Amazon RDS read replicas.
B. Use Amazon ElastiCache for Redis.
C. Use Amazon Route 53 DNS caching
D. Use [[ElastiCache]] for Memcached.
A
**Why Not ElastiCache for Redis or Memcached? (Options B and D)**:

- **ElastiCache** (both Redis and Memcached) could be a good option if caching specific types of frequently accessed data is feasible, such as query results, session data, or specific lookup data.
- However, integrating caching effectively often requires changes in the application code to handle cache reads/writes, cache expiration, and cache invalidation logic. This approach could add operational complexity compared to using RDS read replicas, which provide a straightforward way to offload reads with minimal changes to the application.

### 194
A company needs to run a critical application on AWS. The company needs to use Amazon EC2 for the application’s database. The database must be highly available and must fail over automatically if a disruptive event occurs.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A. Launch two EC2 instances, each in a different Availability Zone in the same AWS Region. Install the database on both EC2 instances.
Configure the EC2 instances as a cluster. Set up database replication.
B. Launch an EC2 instance in an Availability Zone. Install the database on the EC2 instance. Use an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) to back up
the data. Use AWS CloudFormation to automate provisioning of the EC2 instance if a disruptive event occurs.
C. Launch two EC2 instances, each in a different AWS Region. Install the database on both EC2 instances. Set up database replication. Fail
over the database to a second Region.
D. Launch an EC2 instance in an Availability Zone. Install the database on the EC2 instance. Use an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) to back up
the data. Use EC2 automatic recovery to recover the instance if a disruptive event occurs.
C
> requests is sending to region -> auto AZ FO handle\ing

**Why Not Option C (Two EC2 Instances in Different Regions with Replication)**:
- Deploying instances across **different Regions** adds latency and increases complexity in replication. **Cross-Region replication** is not necessary for high availability within a single Region and would increase costs and complexity.
- Additionally, automatic failover between Regions is complex and generally not required unless disaster recovery across Regions is explicitly needed.
### 195
A company’s order system sends requests from clients to Amazon EC2 instances. The EC2 instances process the orders and then store the orders in a database on Amazon RDS. Users report that they must reprocess orders when the system fails. The company wants a resilient solution that can process orders automatically if a system **outage** occurs.
What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?
> outage: a period when a power supply or other service is not available or when equipment is closed down.

A. Move the EC2 instances into an Auto Scaling group. Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule to target an Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) task.
B. Move the EC2 instances into an Auto Scaling group behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). Update the order system to send messages to the ALB endpoint.
C. Move the EC2 instances into an Auto Scaling group. Configure the order system to send messages to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Configure the EC2 instances to consume messages from the queue.

The size of the DynamoDB table continuously grows, but the application needs only data from the last 30 days. The company needs a solution that minimizes cost and development effort.
Which solution meets these requirements?
A. Use an AWS CloudFormation template to deploy the complete solution. Redeploy the CloudFormation stack every 30 days, and delete the original stack.
B. Use an EC2 instance that runs a monitoring application from AWS Marketplace. Configure the monitoring application to use Amazon DynamoDB Streams to store the timestamp when a new item is created in the table. Use a script that runs on the EC2 instance to delete items that have a timestamp that is older than 30 days.
C. Configure Amazon DynamoDB Streams to invoke an AWS Lambda function when a new item is created in the table. Configure the Lambda function to delete items in the table that are older than 30 days.

D. Create a public Amazon S3 bucket. Configure AWS Transfer for SFTP. Configure the S3 bucket for website hosting. Upload website content by using the SFTP client.

> C
1. **Option C: Private Amazon S3 Bucket with CloudFront Origin Access Identity (OAI)**:
   - Using an **Amazon S3 bucket** to store static website content is a cost-effective, highly resilient, and managed solution that doesn’t require a server.
   - Making the S3 bucket **private** and allowing access only via a CloudFront **Origin Access Identity (OAI)** ensures that the content is secure and not directly accessible over the internet. Instead, all access is controlled through CloudFront, improving security.
   - This setup allows for seamless scaling, as ==S3 natively handles large volumes of requests without the need for Auto Scaling or load balancers.==
   - The **AWS CLI** can be used to upload content, which provides a simple and cost-effective approach. If necessary, a variety of other AWS or third-party tools can also interact with S3 to upload content.

>  A **public S3 bucket** would expose content directly on the internet, which is less secure and doesn’t align with best practices. Using a ==private S3 bucket with an OAI== is more secure.
>  
>  **AWS Transfer for SFTP** incurs additional costs and is more suitable for high-frequency SFTP transfer needs. For infrequent updates, the AWS CLI or the S3 console is sufficient and more cost-effective.

A company wants to manage Amazon Machine Images (AMIs). The company currently copies AMIs to the same AWS Region where the AMIs were created. The company needs to design an application that captures AWS API calls and sends alerts whenever the Amazon EC2 CreateImage API operation is called within the company’s account.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
A. Create an AWS Lambda function to query [[CloudTrail]] logs and to send an alert when a CreateImage API call is detected.
B. Configure AWS CloudTrail with an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) notification that occurs when updated logs are sent to Amazon S3. Use Amazon Athena to create a new table and to query on CreateImage when an API call is detected.
C. Create an [[EventBridge]] (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule for the CreateImage API call. Configure the target as an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic to send an alert when a CreateImage API call is detected.
D. Configure an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) FIFO queue as a target for AWS CloudTrail logs. Create an AWS Lambda function to send an alert to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic when a CreateImage API call is detected.

### 207
A company owns an asynchronous API that is used to ingest user requests and, based on the request type, dispatch requests to the appropriate microservice for processing. The company is using Amazon API Gateway to deploy the API front end, and an AWS Lambda function that invokes Amazon DynamoDB to store user requests before dispatching them to the processing microservices.
The company provisioned as much DynamoDB throughput as its budget allows, but the company is still experiencing availability issues and is losing user requests.
What should a solutions architect do to address this issue without impacting existing users?
A. Add throttling on the API Gateway with server-side throttling limits.
B. Use [[DynamoDB]] Accelerator (DAX) and Lambda to buffer writes to DynamoDB.
C. Create a secondary index in DynamoDB for the table with the user requests.
D. Use the Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue and Lambda to buffer writes to DynamoDB.

### 208
A company needs to move data from an Amazon EC2 instance to an Amazon S3 bucket. The company must ensure that no API calls and no data are routed through public internet routes. Only the EC2 instance can have access to upload data to the S3 bucket.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A. Create an interface VPC endpoint for Amazon S3 in the subnet where the EC2 instance is located. Attach a resource policy to the S3 bucket to only allow the EC2 instance’s IAM role for access.
B. Create a gateway VPC endpoint for Amazon S3 in the Availability Zone where the EC2 instance is located. Attach appropriate security groups to the endpoint. Attach a resource policy to the S3 bucket to only allow the EC2 instance’s IAM role for access.
C. Run the nslookup tool from inside the EC2 instance to obtain the private IP address of the S3 bucket’s service API endpoint. Create a route in the VPC route table to provide the EC2 instance with access to the S3 bucket. Attach a resource policy to the S3 bucket to only allow the EC2 instance’s IAM role for access.
D. Use the AWS provided, publicly available ip-ranges.json file to obtain the private IP address of the S3 bucket’s service API endpoint. Create a route in the VPC route table to provide the EC2 instance with access to the S3 bucket. Attach a resource policy to the S3 bucket to only allow the EC2 instance’s IAM role for access.

> B

1. **Gateway VPC Endpoint for Amazon S3**:
    - A gateway VPC endpoint for Amazon S3 enables instances in a VPC to connect to S3 without going over the public internet. This allows traffic to remain within the AWS network, meeting the requirement to avoid public internet routes.
    - Gateway endpoints are specifically used to connect to S3 and DynamoDB services within a VPC without using the public internet.
2. **Control Access via Bucket Policy**:
    - You can attach a bucket policy to restrict access so that only the EC2 instance's IAM role can access the S3 bucket. This ensures that only authorized requests from the EC2 instance can interact with the bucket.
3. **Avoiding the Public Internet**:
    - By using a VPC gateway endpoint, data transfers between the EC2 instance and the S3 bucket stay entirely within the AWS private network, ensuring no public internet routes are used.

> Why **Option A** is not ideal:
- **Interface VPC Endpoint**: An interface VPC endpoint is typically used to privately connect to AWS services powered by AWS PrivateLink, which is different from a gateway VPC endpoint.
- Amazon S3 does not use interface endpoints but rather gateway endpoints to avoid routing data over the public internet. Therefore, creating an interface VPC endpoint for S3 would not fulfill the requirement.

> an **interface endpoint** in AWS (using AWS PrivateLink) does have a static IP address within your VPC.
### 1. **Interface Endpoint (AWS PrivateLink)**
- **Static IP Address**: Each interface endpoint is an Elastic Network Interface (ENI) within a VPC subnet, and it has a static private IP address. This IP address remains fixed as long as the interface endpoint exists.
- **DNS Names**: AWS automatically generates DNS names for the endpoint, allowing you to use these names to access services. The DNS names resolve to the static IPs of the endpoint ENIs within your VPC.
### 2. **Gateway Endpoint**
- **No Static IP Address**: A gateway endpoint does not use specific IP addresses that you can connect to directly. Instead, it works by modifying your route tables.
- **Route Table Entries**: The gateway endpoint for Amazon S3 or DynamoDB modifies the VPC route tables to ensure that traffic to these services is routed internally within AWS’s network.

A solutions architect is designing the architecture of a new application being deployed to the AWS Cloud. The application will run on Amazon EC2 On-Demand Instances and will automatically scale across multiple Availability Zones. The EC2 instances will scale up and down frequently throughout the day. An Application Load Balancer (ALB) will handle the load distribution. The architecture needs to support distributed session data management. The company is willing to make changes to code if needed.
What should the solutions architect do to ensure that the architecture supports distributed session data management?
A. Use Amazon ElastiCache to manage and store session data.
B. Use session affinity (sticky sessions) of the ALB to manage session data.
C. Use Session Manager from [[Systems Manager]] to manage the session.
D. Use the GetSessionToken API operation in AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS) to manage the session.
The correct answer is A. Use Amazon ElastiCache to manage and store session data. In order to support distributed session data management in this scenario, it is necessary to use a distributed data store such as Amazon ElastiCache. This will allow the session data to be stored and accessed by multiple EC2 instances across multiple Availability Zones, which is necessary for a scalable and highly available architecture.

Option B, using session affinity (sticky sessions) of the ALB, would not be sufficient because this would only allow the session data to be stored on
single EC2 instance, which would not be able to scale across multiple Availability Zones.

A company offers a food delivery service that is growing rapidly. Because of the growth, the company’s order processing system is experiencing scaling problems during peak traffic hours. The current architecture includes the following:
• A group of Amazon EC2 instances that run in an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group to collect orders from the application
• Another group of EC2 instances that run in an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group to fulfill orders
The order collection process occurs quickly, but the order fulfillment process can take longer. Data must not be lost because of a scaling event.
A solutions architect must ensure that the order collection process and the order fulfillment process can both scale properly during peak traffic hours. The solution must optimize utilization of the company’s AWS resources.
Which solution meets these requirements?
A. Use Amazon CloudWatch metrics to monitor the CPU of each instance in the Auto Scaling groups. Configure each Auto Scaling group’s minimum capacity according to peak workload values.
B. Use Amazon CloudWatch metrics to monitor the CPU of each instance in the Auto Scaling groups. Configure a CloudWatch alarm to invoke
an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic that creates additional Auto Scaling groups on demand.
C. Provision two Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queues: one for order collection and another for order fulfillment. Configure the EC2 instances to poll their respective queue. Scale the Auto Scaling groups based on notifications that the queues send.
D. Provision two Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queues: one for order collection and another for order fulfillment. Configure the EC2 instances to poll their respective queue. Create a metric based on a backlog per instance calculation. Scale the Auto Scaling groups based on this metric.

1. **队列中的积压**：
    - 在消息队列系统（如 Amazon SQS）中，**backlog** 指的是队列中尚未处理的消息数量。如果处理速度跟不上消息的生成速度，这些未处理的消息就会积压在队列中。系统会在一定时间内积累这些待处理消息，直到有足够的处理能力来处理它们。
    - 例如，在电商平台中，订单处理系统可能会积压未处理的订单，尤其是在高流量时段，直到系统有足够的资源来完成订单。
2. **任务积压**：
    - 在项目管理或开发过程中，**backlog** 指的是待完成的工作项、任务或用户故事。这些任务被列在“待做清单”中，通常会按照优先级排序，以确保最重要的任务优先完成。
        
3. **请求积压**：
    - 在 Web 服务或 API 中，**backlog** 可能表示请求的等待队列。如果系统无法即时响应所有请求，未被立即处理的请求会进入队列，等待被处理。

A company hosts multiple production applications. One of the applications consists of resources from Amazon EC2, AWS Lambda, Amazon RDS, Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS), and Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) across multiple AWS Regions. All company resources are tagged with a tag name of “application” and a value that corresponds to each application. A solutions architect must provide the quickest solution for identifying all of the tagged components.
Which solution meets these requirements?
A. Use AWS CloudTrail to generate a list of resources with the application tag.
B. Use the AWS CLI to query each service across all Regions to report the tagged components.
C. Run a query in Amazon CloudWatch Logs Insights to report on the components with the application tag.
D. Run a query with the AWS Resource Groups Tag Editor to report on the resources globally with the application tag.

A is not the quickest solution because CloudTrail primarily focuses on capturing and logging API activity. While it can provide information about
resource changes, it may not provide a comprehensive and quick way to identify all the tagged components across multiple services and Regions.
B involves manually querying each service using the AWS CLI, which can be time-consuming and cumbersome, especially when dealing with
multiple services and Regions. It is not the most efficient solution for quickly identifying tagged components.
C is focused on analyzing logs rather than directly identifying the tagged components. While CloudWatch Logs Insights can help extract
information from logs, it may not provide a straightforward and quick way to gather a consolidated list of all tagged components across different
services and Regions.
D is the quickest solution as it leverages the Resource Groups Tag Editor, which is specifically designed for managing and organizing resources
based on tags. It offers a centralized and efficient approach to generate a report of tagged components across multiple services and Regions.

A company needs to export its database once a day to Amazon S3 for other teams to access. The exported object size varies between 2 GB and 5 GB. The S3 access pattern for the data is variable and changes rapidly. The data must be immediately available and must remain accessible for up to 3 months. The company needs the most cost-effective solution that will not increase retrieval time.
Which S3 storage class should the company use to meet these requirements?
A. S3 Intelligent-Tiering
B. S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval
C. S3 Standard
D. S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)
I think it cannot be clearly answered because we know that the 'access pattern is variable and changes rapidly', but ultimately it depends on the
total number and volume of accesses. All four options meet the "not increase retrieval time" requirement (even Glacier Instant Retrieval has "the
same latency and access time as S3 Standard"). If data would be rarely accessed, B would be cheapest. If it would be constantly accessed, C would
be cheapest (we'd pay the Intelligent Tiering fee but it would never move anything to a cheaper tier). Inbetween it would be D.
But I guess the key is Amazon's clear recommendation to use Intelligent Tiering (A) for "unknown or changing access" patterns, which matches the
statement in the question.
S3 Intelligent-Tiering monitors access patterns and moves objects that have not been accessed for 30 consecutive days to the Infrequent Access
tier and after 90 days of no access to the Archive Instant Access tier.

The company has minimal infrastructure and operational staff. The company needs to reduce its share of the responsibility in managing, updating, and securing servers for its AWS environment.
What should a solutions architect recommend to meet these requirements?
A. Configure [[WAF]] rules and associate them with the ALB.
B. Deploy the application using Amazon S3 with public hosting enabled.
C. Deploy [[Shield]] Advanced and add the ALB as a protected resource.

A company has 700 TB of backup data stored in network attached storage (NAS) in its data center. This backup data need to be accessible for infrequent **regulatory** requests and must be retained 7 years. The company has decided to migrate this backup data from its data center to AWS. The migration must be complete within 1 month. The company has 500 Mbps of dedicated bandwidth on its public internet connection available for data transfer.
rate = `500/8/1000000 => 5/800000 TB/s `
timeInSec = `700 / rate = 14X8X10^6 = 112X10^6`
timeInMonth = `timeInSec / 60 / 60 / 24 / 30 = 112*10^3 / 36X72 => 10^5/2800 > 1 month`
What should a solutions architect do to migrate and store the data at the LOWEST cost?
A. Order AWS Snowball devices to transfer the data. Use a lifecycle policy to transition the files to Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive.
B. Deploy a VPN connection between the data center and Amazon VPC. Use the AWS CLI to copy the data from on premises to Amazon S3 Glacier.
C. Provision a 500 Mbps AWS Direct Connect connection and transfer the data to Amazon S3. Use a lifecycle policy to transition the files to Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive.
D. Use AWS DataSync to transfer the data and deploy a DataSync agent on premises. Use the DataSync task to copy files from the on-premises
NAS storage to Amazon S3 Glacier.

A company has a serverless website with millions of objects in an Amazon S3 bucket. The company uses the S3 bucket as the origin for an Amazon CloudFront distribution. The company did not set encryption on the S3 bucket before the objects were loaded. A solutions architect needs to enable encryption for all existing objects and for all objects that are added to the S3 bucket in the future.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST amount of effort?
A. Create a new S3 bucket. Turn on the default encryption settings for the new S3 bucket. Download all existing objects to temporary local storage. Upload the objects to the new S3 bucket.
B. Turn on the default encryption settings for the S3 bucket. Use the S3 Inventory feature to create a .csv file that lists the unencrypted objects. Run an S3 Batch Operations job that uses the copy command to encrypt those objects.
C. Create a new encryption key by using AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS). Change the settings on the S3 bucket to use server-side encryption with AWS KMS managed encryption keys (SSE-KMS). Turn on versioning for the S3 bucket.
D. Navigate to Amazon S3 in the AWS Management Console. Browse the S3 bucket’s objects. Sort by the encryption field. Select each unencrypted object. Use the Modify button to apply default encryption settings to every unencrypted object in the S3 bucket.
B

Step 1: S3 inventory to get object list (@S3 inventory is a functionality used for S3 object management such as list )
Step 2 (If needed): Use S3 Select to filter
Step 3: S3 object operations to encrypt the unencrypted objects.

By enabling default encryption settings on the S3, all newly added objects will be automatically encrypted. To encrypt the existing objects, the S3
Inventory feature can be used to generate a list of unencrypted objects. Then, an S3 Batch Operations job can be executed to copy those objects
while applying encryption.

SSE with KMS enabled will only applies encryption to new objects added to the bucket

A company runs a global web application on Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer. The application stores data in Amazon Aurora. The company needs to create a [[DR strategy]] solution and can tolerate up to 30 minutes of downtime and potential data loss. The solution does not need to handle the load when the primary infrastructure is healthy.
What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?
A. Deploy the application with the required infrastructure elements in place. Use Amazon Route 53 to configure active-passive failover. Create an Aurora Replica in a second AWS Region.
B. Host a ==scaled-down deployment== of the application in a second AWS Region. Use Amazon Route 53 to configure **active-active failover**. Create an Aurora Replica in the second Region.
C. Replicate the primary infrastructure in a second AWS Region. Use Amazon Route 53 to configure **active-active failover**. Create an Aurora database that is restored from the latest snapshot.
D. Back up data with AWS Backup. Use the backup to create the required infrastructure in a second AWS Region. Use Amazon Route 53 to configure active-passive failover. Create an Aurora second primary instance in the second Region.


> scaled-down deployment


A

Anything that is not instant recovery is active - passive.
In active -passive we have :
1. Aws Backup(least op overhead) - RTO/RPO = hours
2. Pilot Light ( Basic Infra is already deployed, but needs to be fully implemented) -RTO/RPO = 10's of minutes.
3. Warm Standby- (Basic infra + runs small loads ( might need to add auto scaling) -RTO/RPO= minutes
4. ( ACTIVE -ACTIVE ) : Multi AZ option : instant

hence B,D are incorrect. AWS backup is in hours(too slow for 30 mins requirement)

E. Update the [[Network ACL]] to allow inbound TCP port 443 from source 0.0.0.0/0 and outbound TCP port 32768-65535 to destination 0.0.0.0/0.

A E

"On Windows, the ephemeral port range is usually from 49152 to 65535.
On Linux, it is often from 32768 to 61000."

A company’s application is having performance issues. The application is stateful and needs to complete in-memory tasks on Amazon EC2 instances. The company used AWS CloudFormation to deploy infrastructure and used the M5 EC2 instance family. As traffic increased, the application performance degraded. Users are reporting delays when the users attempt to access the application.
Which solution will resolve these issues in the MOST operationally efficient way?
A. Replace the EC2 instances with T3 EC2 instances that run in an Auto Scaling group. Make the changes by using the AWS Management Console.
B. Modify the CloudFormation templates to run the EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group. Increase the desired capacity and the maximum capacity of the Auto Scaling group manually when an increase is necessary.
C. Modify the CloudFormation templates. Replace the EC2 instances with R5 EC2 instances. Use Amazon CloudWatch built-in EC2 memory metrics to track the application performance for future capacity planning.

A company runs an application on a group of Amazon Linux EC2 instances. For compliance reasons, the company must retain all application log files for 7 years. The log files will be analyzed by a reporting tool that must be able to access all the files concurrently.
Which storage solution meets these requirements MOST cost-effectively?
A. Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS)
B. Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS)
C. Amazon EC2 instance store
D. Amazon 
D
A. EBS provides block-level storage volumes for use with EC2 instances. While it offers durability and persistence, it is not the most cost-effective
solution for long-term retention of log files. Additionally, it does not provide concurrent access to the files, which is a requirement in this scenario.
B. EFS is a scalable file storage service that can be mounted on multiple EC2 instances concurrently. While it provides concurrent access to files, it
may not be the most cost-effective option for long-term retention due to its higher pricing compared to S3.

considering the requirements for long-term retention, concurrent access, and cost-effectiveness, S3 is the most suitable and cost-
effective storage solution.

A. Create an IAM role in the company’s account to delegate access to the vendor’s IAM role. Attach the appropriate IAM policies to the role for
the permissions that the vendor requires.
B. Create an IAM user in the company’s account with a password that meets the password complexity requirements. Attach the appropriate
IAM policies to the user for the permissions that the vendor requires.
C. Create an IAM group in the company’s account. Add the tool’s IAM user from the vendor account to the group. Attach the appropriate IAM
policies to the group for the permissions that the vendor requires.
D. Create a new identity provider by choosing “AWS account” as the provider type in the IAM console. Supply the vendor’s AWS account ID and user name. Attach the appropriate IAM policies to the new provider for the permissions that the vendor requires.
#useful 
A
By creating an IAM role and delegating access to the vendor's IAM role, you establish a trust relationship between accounts. This allows the
vendor's automated tool to assume the role in the company's account and access the necessary resources.
By attaching the appropriate IAM policies to the role, you can define the precise permissions that the vendor requires for their tool to perform its
tasks. This ensures that the vendor has the necessary access without granting them direct IAM access to the company's account

A company recently migrated its web application to AWS by rehosting the application on Amazon EC2 instances in a single AWS Region. The company wants to redesign its application architecture to be highly available and fault tolerant. Traffic must reach all running EC2 instances randomly.
Which combination of steps should the company take to meet these requirements? (Choose two.)
A. Create an Amazon Route 53 failover routing policy.
B. Create an Amazon Route 53 weighted routing policy.
C. Create an Amazon Route 53 **multivalue answer routing policy.**
D. Launch three EC2 instances: two instances in one Availability Zone and one instance in another Availability Zone.
E. Launch four EC2 instances: two instances in one Availability Zone and two instances in another Availability Zone.
(@Region route -> Route 53 DNS)

```
C. A multivalue answer routing policy in Route 53 allows you to configure multiple values for a DNS record, and Route 53 responds to DNS queries
with multiple random values. This enables the distribution of traffic randomly among the available EC2 instances.
E. By launching EC2 instances in different AZs, you achieve high availability and fault tolerance. Launching four instances (two in each AZ) ensures
that there are enough resources to handle the traffic load and maintain the desired level of availability.
A. Failover routing is designed to direct traffic to a backup resource or secondary location only when the primary resource or location is
unavailable.
B. Although a weighted routing policy allows you to distribute traffic across multiple EC2 instances, it does not ensure random distribution.
D. While launching instances in multiple AZs is important for fault tolerance, having only three instances does not provide an even distribution of
traffic. With only three instances, the traffic may not be evenly distributed, potentially leading to imbalanced resource utilization.

Q: I chose CE, but couldn't it also be BE? If you set all of the weights to the same, equal value? Wouldn't then the traffic be distributed randomly and evenly among all healthy instances?
A: This is "equal distribution", not "random distribution"; think about the differences

A company needs to retain its [[CloudTrail]] logs for 3 years. The company is enforcing CloudTrail across a set of AWS accounts by using AWS Organizations from the parent account. The CloudTrail target S3 bucket is configured with S3 Versioning enabled. An S3 Lifecycle policy is in place to delete current objects after 3 years. After the fourth year of use of the S3 bucket, the S3 bucket metrics show that the number of objects has continued to rise. However, the number of new CloudTrail logs that are delivered to the S3 bucket has remained consistent. 
Which solution will delete objects that are older than 3 years in the MOST cost-effective manner?
A. Configure the organization’s centralized CloudTrail trail to expire objects after 3 years.
B. Configure the S3 Lifecycle policy to delete previous versions as well as current versions.
C. Create an AWS Lambda function to enumerate and delete objects from Amazon S3 that are older than 3 years.
D. Configure the parent account as the owner of all objects that are delivered to the S3 bucket

B
• Versioning has caused the number of objects to increase over time, even as current objects are deleted after 3 years. By deleting previous versions as well, this will clean up old object versions and reduce storage costs.
• An S3 Lifecycle policy incurs no additional charges and requires no additional resources to configure and run. It is a native S3 tool for managing object lifecycles cost-effectively.
#useful former version of object will not be deleted !

I did something similar recently : Lifecycle is triggered more or less each 24 hours, in my case it removed hundreds of gigabytes and millions of small files in one shot. Using another mechanism like a script would have taken days if not weeks.
### 228
A company has an API that receives real-time data from a fleet of monitoring devices. The API stores this data in an Amazon RDS DB instance for later analysis. The amount of data that the monitoring devices send to the API fluctuates. During periods of heavy traffic, the API often returns timeout errors.
After an inspection of the logs, the company determines that the database is not capable of processing the volume of write traffic that comes from the API. A solutions architect must minimize the number of connections to the database and must ensure that data is not lost during periods of heavy traffic.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A. Increase the size of the DB instance to an instance type that has more available memory.
B. Modify the DB instance to be a Multi-AZ DB instance. Configure the application to write to all active RDS DB instances.
C. Modify the API to write incoming data to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Use an AWS Lambda function that Amazon SQS invokes to write data from the queue to the database.
D. Modify the API to write incoming data to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic. Use an AWS Lambda function that Amazon SNS invokes to write data from the topic to the database.
C

- **Batch Processing**: Lambda can retrieve multiple messages from SQS at once, reducing the total number of individual write operations to the database.
- **Concurrency Controls**: Lambda has a concurrency setting that can limit the number of concurrent executions. This means that even if the SQS queue has a lot of messages, Lambda will only connect to the database with the configured level of concurrency, avoiding excessive connections during peak times.

A company manages its own Amazon EC2 instances that run MySQL databases. The company is manually managing replication and scaling as demand increases or decreases. The company needs a new solution that simplifies the process of adding or removing compute capacity to or from its database tier as needed. The solution also must offer improved  erformance, scaling, and durability with minimal effort from operations.
Which solution meets these requirements?
A. Migrate the databases to ==Amazon Aurora Serverless== for Aurora MySQL.
B. Migrate the databases to Amazon Aurora Serverless for Aurora PostgreSQL.
C. Combine the databases into one larger MySQL database. Run the larger database on larger EC2 instances.
D. Create an EC2 Auto Scaling group for the database tier. Migrate the existing databases to the new environment.

Migrating the databases to Aurora Serverless provides automated scaling and replication capabilities. Aurora Serverless automatically scales the capacity based on the workload, allowing for seamless addition or removal of compute capacity as needed. It also offers improved performance, durability, and high availability without requiring manual management of replication and scaling.

### 231
An application runs on an Amazon EC2 instance that has an Elastic IP address in VPC A. The application requires access to a database in VPC B. Both VPCs are in the same AWS account.
Which solution will provide the required access MOST securely?
A. Create a DB instance security group that allows all traffic from the public IP address of the application server in VPC A.
B. Configure a VPC peering connection between VPC A and VPC B.
C. Make the DB instance publicly accessible. Assign a public IP address to the DB instance.
D. Launch an EC2 instance with an Elastic IP address into VPC B. Proxy all requests through the new EC2 instance.

The most secure solution is to configure a VPC peering connection between the two VPCs. This allows private communication between the
application server and the database, without exposing resources to the public internet.
Option A exposes the database to the public internet by allowing inbound traffic from a public IP address.
### 232
A company runs demonstration environments for its customers on Amazon EC2 instances. Each environment is isolated in its own VPC. The company’s operations team needs to be notified when RDP or SSH access to an environment has been established.

A company is building a new web-based customer relationship management application. The application will use several Amazon EC2 instances that are backed by Amazon Elastic Block Store ([[EBS]]) volumes behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). The application will also use an Amazon Aurora database. All data for the application must be encrypted at rest and in transit.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A. Use AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) certificates on the ALB to encrypt data in transit. Use AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to encrypt the EBS volumes and Aurora database storage at rest.
B. Use the AWS root account to log in to the AWS Management Console. Upload the company’s encryption certificates. While in the root account, select the option to turn on encryption for all data at rest and in transit for the account.

C. Use AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) to encrypt the EBS volumes and Aurora database storage at rest. Attach an AWS Certificate
Manager (ACM) certificate to the ALB to encrypt data in transit.

D. Use BitLocker to encrypt all data at rest. Import the company’s TLS certificate keys to AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) Attach the KMS keys to the ALB to encrypt data in transit.

### 235
A company is moving its on-premises Oracle database to Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL. The database has several applications that write to the same tables. The applications need to be migrated one by one with a month in between each migration. Management has expressed concerns that the database has a high number of reads and writes. The data must be kept in sync across both databases throughout the migration.
What should a solutions architect recommend?

A. Use AWS DataSync for the initial migration. Use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) to create a change data capture (CDC) replication task and a table mapping to select all tables.
B. Use AWS DataSync for the initial migration. Use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) to create a full load plus change data capture (CDC) replication task and a table mapping to select all tables.
C. Use the AWS Schema Conversion Tool with AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) using a memory optimized replication instance. Create a full load plus change data capture (CDC) replication task and a table mapping to select all tables.
D. Use the AWS Schema Conversion Tool with AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) using a compute optimized replication instance. Create a full load plus change data capture (CDC) replication task and a table mapping to select the largest tables.

> C : because we need SCT to convert from Oracle to PostgreSQL, and we need memory optimized machine for databases not compute optimized. 
> A memory-optimized replication instance is recommended because the database has a high number of reads and writes. Memory-optimized instances are designed to deliver fast performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory.

in D we create a table mapping only for "the largest tables" while obviously we need "all tables" as in C.
### 236
A company has a three-tier application for image sharing. The application uses an Amazon EC2 instance for the front-end layer, another EC2 instance for the application layer, and a third EC2 instance for a MySQL database. A solutions architect must design a scalable and highly available solution that requires the least amount of change to the application.
Which solution meets these requirements?
A. Use Amazon S3 to host the front-end layer. Use AWS Lambda functions for the application layer. Move the database to an Amazon DynamoDB table. Use Amazon S3 to store and serve users’ images.
B. Use load-balanced Multi-AZ AWS Elastic Beanstalk environments for the front-end layer and the application layer. Move the database to an **Amazon RDS DB** instance with multiple read replicas to serve users’ images.
C. Use Amazon S3 to host the front-end layer. Use a fleet of EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group for the application layer. Move the database to a memory optimized instance type to store and serve users’ images.
D. Use load-balanced Multi-AZ [[Elastic Beanstalk]] environments for the front-end layer and the application layer. Move the database to an
Amazon RDS ==Multi-AZ== DB instance. Use Amazon S3 to store and serve users’ images.

### 237
An application running on an Amazon EC2 instance in VPC-A needs to access files in another EC2 instance in VPC-B. Both VPCs are in separate AWS accounts. The network administrator needs to design a solution to configure secure access to EC2 instance in VPC-B from VPC-A. The connectivity should not have a single point of failure or bandwidth concerns.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A. Set up a VPC peering connection between VPC-A and VPC-B. (@ can VPC peering established between different account? )
B. Set up VPC gateway endpoints for the EC2 instance running in VPC-B.
C. Attach a [[virtual private gateway]] to VPC-B and set up routing from VPC-A.
D. Create a private virtual interface ([[VIF]]) for the EC2 instance running in VPC-B and add appropriate routes from VPC-A.

D

AWS uses the existing infrastructure of a VPC to create a VPC peering connection; it is neither a gateway nor a VPN connection, and does not rely on a separate piece of physical hardware. There is no single point of failure for communication or a bandwidth bottleneck.
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/peering/what-is-vpc-peering.html

A VPC peering connection allows secure communication between instances in different VPCs using private IP addresses without the need for
internet gateways, VPN connections, or NAT devices. By setting it up, the application running in VPC-A can directly access the EC2 in VPC-B withou
going through the public internet or any single point of failure.
B is incorrect because VPC gateway endpoints are used for accessing S3 or DynamoDB from a VPC without going over the internet. They are not
designed for establishing connectivity between EC2 instances in different VPCs.
C is incorrect because it would require configuring a VPN connection between the VPCs. This would introduce additional complexity and potential
single points of failure.
D is incorrect because creating a private VIF and adding routes would be applicable for establishing a direct connection between on-premises
infrastructure and VPC-B using Direct Connect, but it is not suitable for the scenario of communication between EC2 instances in separate VPCs
within different AWS accounts.

### 238
A company wants to experiment with individual AWS accounts for its engineer team. The company wants to be notified as soon as the Amazon EC2 instance usage for a given month exceeds a specific threshold for each account.
What should a solutions architect do to meet this requirement MOST cost-effectively?
A. Use Cost Explorer to create a daily report of costs by service. Filter the report by EC2 instances. Configure Cost Explorer to send an Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES) notification when a threshold is exceeded.
B. Use Cost Explorer to create a monthly report of costs by service. Filter the report by EC2 instances. Configure Cost Explorer to send an Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES) notification when a threshold is exceeded.
C. Use AWS Budgets to create a cost budget for ==each account==. Set the ==period== to monthly. Set the ==scope to EC2 instances==. Set an alert threshold for the budget. Configure an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic to receive a notification when a threshold is exceeded.
D. Use AWS Cost and Usage Reports to create a report with hourly granularity. Integrate the report data with Amazon Athena. Use Amazon EventBridge to schedule an Athena query. Configure an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic to receive a notification when a threshold is exceeded.

### 239
A solutions architect needs to design a new microservice for a company’s application. Clients must be able to call an HTTPS endpoint to reach the microservice. The microservice also must use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to authenticate calls. The solutions architect will write the logic for this microservice by using a single [[Lambda]] function that is written in Go 1.x.
Which solution will deploy the function in the MOST operationally efficient way?
A. Create an Amazon API Gateway REST API. Configure the method to use the Lambda function. Enable IAM authentication on the API.
B. Create a Lambda function URL for the function. Specify AWS_IAM as the authentication type.
C. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution. Deploy the function to Lambda@Edge. Integrate IAM authentication logic into the Lambda@Edge function.
D. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution. Deploy the function to CloudFront Functions. Specify AWS_IAM as the authentication type.
B

**Option A (API Gateway with IAM Authentication)**: While API Gateway can integrate with Lambda and supports IAM-based authentication, it adds an additional layer of complexity. API Gateway requires more setup and can add latency and cost.
### 240
A company previously migrated its data warehouse solution to AWS. The company also has an [[Direct Connect]] connection. Corporate office users query the data warehouse using a visualization tool. The average size of a query returned by the data warehouse is 50 MB and each webpage sent by the visualization tool is approximately 500 KB. Result sets returned by the data warehouse are not cached.
Which solution provides the LOWEST data transfer egress cost for the company?
A. Host the visualization tool on premises and query the data warehouse directly over the internet.
B. Host the visualization tool in the same AWS Region as the data warehouse. Access it over the internet.
C. Host the visualization tool on premises and query the data warehouse directly over a Direct Connect connection at a location in the same
AWS Region.
D. Host the visualization tool in the same AWS Region as the data warehouse and access it over a Direct Connect connection at a location in
the same Region.
D
>"Egress transfer" refers to the process of moving data out of a particular system, network, or service to an external destination. This term is commonly associated with cloud services and data centers, where "egress" typically means the data is leaving the provider's network or data center to a different location, such as another cloud, on-premises environment, or a user's local device.

The correct answer is: D

- **Option C** (Host the visualization tool ==on premises== and query the data warehouse directly over a Direct Connect connection at a location in the same AWS Region):  
  While this uses Direct Connect, the data transfer still incurs egress costs because it ==leaves AWS infrastructure== to reach the corporate office.

- **Option D** (Host the visualization tool in the same AWS Region as the data warehouse and access it over a Direct Connect connection at a location in the same Region):  
  This solution incurs the lowest data transfer costs. By hosting the visualization tool in the same AWS Region as the data warehouse and using a Direct Connect connection, the data transfer stays within the AWS Region, and the Direct Connect private connection minimizes egress charges. Data transferred over Direct Connect within the same Region generally has lower rates compared to standard egress charges.

A company hosts its web application on AWS using seven Amazon EC2 instances. The company requires that the IP addresses of all healthy EC2 instances be returned in response to DNS queries. Which policy should be used to meet this requirement?
A. Simple routing policy
B. Latency routing policy
C. Multivalue routing policy
D. Geolocation routing policy
C
> The Multivalue routing policy allows Route 53 to respond to DNS queries with multiple healthy IP addresses for the same resource. This is particularly useful in scenarios where multiple instances are serving the same purpose and need to be load balanced or failover capable. With the Multivalue routing policy, Route 53 returns multiple IP addresses in a random order to distribute the traffic across all healthy instances.

Option A (Simple routing policy) would only return a single IP address in response to DNS queries and does not support returning multiple addresses.
Option B (Latency routing policy) is used to route traffic based on the lowest latency to the resource
Option D (Geolocation routing policy) is used to route traffic based on the geographic location of the user

A solutions architect implements an internet-facing Application Load Balancer (ALB) and specifies the EC2 instances as the target group. However, the internet traffic is not reaching the EC2 instances.
How should the solutions architect reconfigure the architecture to resolve this issue?
A. Replace the ALB with a Network Load Balancer. Configure a NAT gateway in a public subnet to allow internet traffic.
B. Move the EC2 instances to public subnets. Add a rule to the EC2 instances’ security groups to allow outbound traffic to 0.0.0.0/0.
C. Update the route tables for the EC2 instances’ subnets to send 0.0.0.0/0 traffic through the internet gateway route. Add a rule to the EC2 instances’ security groups to allow outbound traffic to 0.0.0.0/0.
