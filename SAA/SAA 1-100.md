A company collects data for temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure in cities across multiple continents. The average volume of data that the company collects from each site daily is 500 GB. Each site has a high-speed Internet connection.  
The company wants to aggregate the data from all these global sites as quickly as possible in a single Amazon S3 bucket. The solution must minimize operational complexity.  
Which solution meets these requirements?

- A. Turn on [[S3 Transfer Acceleration]] on the destination S3 bucket. Use multipart uploads to directly upload site data to the destination S3 bucket.
- B. Upload the data from each site to an S3 bucket in the closest Region. Use S3 Cross-Region Replication to copy objects to the destination S3 bucket. Then remove the data from the origin S3 bucket.
{
- Additional latency due to the replication process after the initial upload.
- More operational complexity since data must be managed in two locations, and you must handle the removal of data from the origin bucket.
- Increased costs due to data transfer across regions and storage in multiple buckets.
}
- ~~C~~. Schedule AWS Snowball Edge Storage Optimized device jobs daily to transfer data from each site to the closest Region. Use S3 Cross-Region Replication to copy objects to the destination S3 bucket. ==(Snowball used when internet connection is bad)==
- D. Upload the data from each site to an Amazon EC2 instance in the closest Region. Store the data in an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume. At regular intervals, take an EBS snapshot and copy it to the Region that contains the destination S3 bucket. Restore the EBS volume in that Region.

A company needs the ability to analyze the log files of its ==proprietary application==(@A proprietary application is a software application that is developed by a company or individual and is owned by the creator). The logs are stored in JSON format in an Amazon S3 bucket. Queries will be simple and will run on-demand. A solutions architect needs to perform the analysis with minimal changes to the existing architecture.  
What should the solutions architect do to meet these requirements with the LEAST amount of operational overhead?

- A. Use Amazon Redshift to load all the content into one place and run the SQL queries as needed. (@two steps)
- B. Use Amazon CloudWatch Logs to store the logs. Run SQL queries as needed from the Amazon CloudWatch console. (@no fit on "on-demand" query requirement)
- C. Use Amazon Athen a directly with Amazon S3 to run the queries as needed.
- D. Use[[Glue]] to catalog the logs. Use a transient Apache Spark cluster on Amazon EMR to run the SQL queries as needed. (@ This take 2 step: use AWS Glue to catalog the logs and use Spark to run SQL query)
simple query -> Athena, complex query-> Redshit

Amazon Athena is a serverless interactive query service that allows you to analyze data directly from Amazon S3 using standard SQL queries. It eliminates the need for infrastructure provisioning or data loading, making it a low-overhead solution. Overall, Amazon Athena offers a straightforward and efficient solution for analyzing log files stored in JSON format, ensuring minimal operational overhead and compatibility with simple on-demand queries.

A company is hosting a web application on AWS using a single Amazon EC2 instance that stores user-uploaded documents in an Amazon EBS volume. For better scalability and availability, the company duplicated the architecture and created a second EC2 instance and EBS volume in another Availability Zone, placing both behind an Application Load Balancer. After completing this change, users reported that, each time they refreshed the website, they could see one subset of their documents or the other, but never all of the documents at the same time.  
What should a solutions architect propose to ensure users see all of their documents at once?
- A. Copy the data so both EBS volumes contain all the documents
- B. Configure the Application Load Balancer to direct a user to the server with the documents
- C. Copy the data from both EBS volumes to Amazon EFS. Modify the application to save new documents to Amazon EFS
- D. Configure the Application Load Balancer to send the request to both servers. Return each document from the correct server

### 10
A company is building an ecommerce web application on AWS. The application sends information about new orders to an Amazon API Gateway REST API to process. The company wants to ensure that orders are processed in the order that they are received.  
Which solution will meet these requirements?

- A. Use an API Gateway integration to publish a message to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic when the application receives an order. Subscribe an AWS Lambda function to the topic to perform processing.
- B. Use an API Gateway integration to send a message to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) FIFO queue when the application receives an order. Configure the SQS FIFO queue to invoke an AWS Lambda function for processing.
- C. Use an API Gateway authorizer to block any requests while the application processes an order.
- D. Use an API Gateway integration to send a message to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) standard queue when the application receives an order. Configure the SQS standard queue to invoke an AWS Lambda function for processing.

### 11
A company has an application that runs on Amazon EC2 instances and uses an Amazon Aurora database. The EC2 instances connect to the database by using user names and passwords that are stored locally in a file. The company wants to minimize the operational overhead of credential management.  
What should a solutions architect do to accomplish this goal?

- A. Use AWS Secrets Manager. Turn on automatic rotation.
- B. Use AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store. Turn on automatic rotation.
- C. Create an Amazon S3 bucket to store objects that are encrypted with an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) encryption key. Migrate the credential file to the S3 bucket. Point the application to the S3 bucket.
- D. Create an encrypted Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume for each EC2 instance. Attach the new EBS volume to each EC2 instance. Migrate the credential file to the new EBS volume. Point the application to the new EBS volume.

1. B is wrong because parameter store does not support auto rotation, unless the customer writes it themselves
2. Aurora manages the settings for the secret and rotates the secret every seven days by default.
3. By leveraging Secrets Manager, the application can retrieve the database credentials programmatically at runtime, eliminating the need to store them locally in a file.

### 12
A global company hosts its web application on Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). The web application has static data and dynamic data. The company stores its static data in an Amazon S3 bucket. The company wants to improve performance and reduce latency for the static data and dynamic data. The company is using its own domain name registered with Amazon Route 53.  
What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?

- A. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution that has the S3 bucket and the ALB as origins. Configure Route 53 to route traffic to the CloudFront distribution.
- B. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution that has the ALB as an origin. Create an AWS Global Accelerator standard accelerator that has the S3 bucket as an endpoint Configure Route 53 to route traffic to the CloudFront distribution.
- C. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution that has the S3 bucket as an origin. Create an AWS Global Accelerator standard accelerator that has the ALB and the CloudFront distribution as endpoints. Create a custom domain name that points to the accelerator DNS name. Use the custom domain name as an endpoint for the web application.
- D. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution that has the ALB as an origin. Create an AWS Global Accelerator standard accelerator that has the S3 bucket as an endpoint. Create two domain names. Point one domain name to the CloudFront DNS name for dynamic content. Point the other domain name to the accelerator DNS name for static content. Use the domain names as endpoints for the web application.

Explanation - AWS Global Accelerator vs CloudFront • They both use the AWS global network and its edge locations around the world • Both services integrate with AWS Shield for DDoS protection. • CloudFront • Improves performance for both cacheable content (such as images and videos) • Dynamic content (such as API acceleration and dynamic site delivery) • Content is served at the edge • Global Accelerator • Improves performance for a wide range of applications over TCP or UDP • Proxying packets at the edge to applications running in one or more AWS Regions. • Good fit for non-HTTP use cases, such as gaming (UDP), IoT (MQTT), or Voice over IP • Good for HTTP use cases that require static IP addresses • Good for HTTP use cases that required deterministic, fast regional failover

Using **CloudFront** in front of the ALB reduces latency because:
2. **Connection Reuse:** Persistent connections minimize setup time.
3. **Caching:** Dynamic content can be cached briefly to speed up responses.
4. **Optimized Routing:** Uses AWS’s private network for faster paths.
5. **TLS Offloading:** Secure connections are handled at the edge, reducing handshake delays.
Direct ALB access skips these optimizations, leading to higher latency, especially for users far from the region.

Route 53 is a DNS service. a DNS service usually route trafic to Frontend site(CloudFront edge endpoint)

An application development team is designing a microservice that will convert large images to smaller, compressed images. When a user uploads an image through the web interface, the microservice should store the image in an Amazon S3 bucket, process and compress the image with an AWS Lambda function, and store the image in its compressed form in a different S3 bucket.  
A solutions architect needs to design a solution that uses durable, stateless components to process the images automatically.  
Which combination of actions will meet these requirements? (Choose two.)

- A. Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Configure the S3 bucket to send a notification to the SQS queue when an image is uploaded to the S3 bucket.
- B. Configure the Lambda function to use the Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue as the invocation source. When the SQS message is successfully processed, delete the message in the queue.
- C. Configure the Lambda function to monitor the S3 bucket for new uploads. When an uploaded image is detected, write the file name to a text file in memory and use the text file to keep track of the images that were processed.
- D. Launch an Amazon EC2 instance to monitor an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. When items are added to the queue, log the file name in a text file on the EC2 instance and invoke the Lambda function.
- E. Configure an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) event to monitor the S3 bucket. When an image is uploaded, send an alert to an Amazon ample Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic with the application owner's email address for further processing.

EventBridge don't provide the same level of durability and scalability as SQS.

A company wants to improve its ability to clone large amounts of production data into a test environment in the same AWS Region. The data is stored in Amazon EC2 instances on Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes. Modifications to the cloned data must not affect the production environment. The software that accesses this data requires consistently high I/O performance.  
A solutions architect needs to minimize the time that is required to clone the production data into the test environment.  
Which solution will meet these requirements?

- A. Take EBS snapshots of the production EBS volumes. Restore the snapshots onto EC2 instance store volumes in the test environment.
- B. Configure the production EBS volumes to use the EBS Multi-Attach feature. Take EBS snapshots of the production EBS volumes. Attach the production EBS volumes to the EC2 instances in the test environment.
- C. Take EBS snapshots of the production EBS volumes. Create and initialize new EBS volumes. Attach the new EBS volumes to EC2 instances in the test environment before restoring the volumes from the production EBS snapshots.
- D. Take EBS snapshots of the production EBS volumes. Turn on the EBS fast snapshot restore feature on the EBS snapshots. Restore the snapshots into new EBS volumes. Attach the new EBS volumes to EC2 instances in the test environment.
Amazon EBS fast snapshot restore (FSR) enables you to create a volume from a snapshot that is fully initialized at creation. This eliminates the latency of I/O operations on a block when it is accessed for the first time. Volumes that are created using fast snapshot restore instantly deliver all of their provisioned performance.

A solutions architect is using Amazon S3 to design the storage architecture of a new digital media application. The media files must be resilient to the loss of an Availability Zone. Some files are accessed frequently while other files are rarely accessed in an unpredictable pattern. The solutions architect must minimize the costs of storing and retrieving the media files.  
Which storage option meets these requirements?

- A. S3 Standard
- B. S3 Intelligent-Tiering
- C. S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)
- D. S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA)

Amazon S3 Intelligent Tiering is a storage class that automatically moves data to the most cost-effective storage tier based on access patterns. It can store objects in two access tiers: the frequent access tier and the infrequent access tier. The frequent access tier is optimized for frequently accessed objects and is charged at the same rate as S3 Standard. The infrequent access tier is optimized for objects that are not accessed frequently and are charged at a lower rate than S3 Standard. S3 Intelligent Tiering is a good choice for storing media files that are accessed frequently and infrequently in an unpredictable pattern because it automatically moves data to the most cost-effective storage tier based on access patterns, minimizing storage and retrieval costs. It is also resilient to the loss of an Availability Zone because it stores objects in multiple Availability Zones within a region.

A company is designing an application. The application uses an AWS Lambda function to receive information through Amazon API Gateway and to store the information in an Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL database.  
During the proof-of-concept stage, the company has to increase the Lambda quotas significantly to handle the high volumes of data that the company needs to load into the database. A solutions architect must recommend a new design to improve scalability and minimize the configuration effort.  
Which solution will meet these requirements?

- A. Refactor the Lambda function code to Apache Tomcat code that runs on Amazon EC2 instances. Connect the database by using native Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) drivers.
- B. Change the platform from Aurora to Amazon DynamoDProvision a DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) cluster. Use the DAX client SDK to point the existing DynamoDB API calls at the DAX cluster.
- C. Set up two Lambda functions. Configure one function to receive the information. Configure the other function to load the information into the database. Integrate the Lambda functions by using Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS).
- D. Set up two Lambda functions. Configure one function to receive the information. Configure the other function to load the information into the database. Integrate the Lambda functions by using an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue.


A - refactoring can be a solution, BUT requires a LOT of effort
B - DynamoDB is NoSQL and Aurora is SQL, so it requires a DB migration... again a LOT of effort
C and D are similar in structure, but... C uses SNS, which would notify the 2nd Lambda function... provoking the same bottleneck..
D uses SQS, so the 2nd lambda function can go to the queue when responsive to keep with the DB load process. Usually the app ==decoupling== helps with the performance improvement by distributing load. In this case, the bottleneck is solved by uses queues... 

**D**

A company needs to review its AWS Cloud deployment to ensure that its Amazon S3 buckets do not have unauthorized configuration changes.  
What should a solutions architect do to accomplish this goal?

- A. Turn on AWS Config with the appropriate rules.
- B. Turn on AWS Trusted Advisor with the appropriate checks.
- C. Turn on Amazon Inspector with the appropriate assessment template.
- D. Turn on Amazon S3 server access logging. Configure Amazon EventBridge (Amazon Cloud Watch Events).

AWS Config is a service that enables you to assess, audit, and evaluate the configurations of your AWS resources. You can use AWS Config to monitor and record changes to the configuration of your Amazon S3 buckets. By turning on AWS Config and enabling the appropriate rules, you can ensure that your S3 buckets do not have unauthorized configuration changes.

A company is launching a new application and will display application metrics on an Amazon CloudWatch dashboard. The company's product manager needs to access this dashboard periodically. The product manager does not have an AWS account. A solutions architect must provide access to the product manager by following the principle of least privilege.  
Which solution will meet these requirements?
- A. Share the dashboard from the CloudWatch console. Enter the product manager's email address, and complete the sharing steps. Provide a shareable link for the dashboard to the product manager.
- B. Create an IAM user specifically for the product manager. Attach the CloudWatchReadOnlyAccess AWS managed policy to the user. Share the new login credentials with the product manager. Share the browser URL of the correct dashboard with the product manager.
- C. Create an IAM user for the company's employees. Attach the ViewOnlyAccess AWS managed policy to the IAM user. Share the new login credentials with the product manager. Ask the product manager to navigate to the CloudWatch console and locate the dashboard by name in the Dashboards section.
- D. Deploy a bastion server in a public subnet. When the product manager requires access to the dashboard, start the server and share the RDP credentials. On the bastion server, ensure that the browser is configured to open the dashboard URL with cached AWS credentials that have appropriate permissions to view the dashboard.

Share a single dashboard and designate specific email addresses of the people who can view the dashboard. Each of these users creates their own password that they must enter to view the dashboard.
b has a problem for cloudwatchreadonlyacess policy, it’s not only grant read access to dashboard, but other read permission for logs, insights, etc. so it does not follows the principle of least privilege. Option A only grants access to dashboard.

A company provides a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) service that uses UDP connections. The service consists of Amazon EC2 instances that run in an Auto Scaling group. The company has deployments across multiple AWS Regions.  
The company needs to route users to the Region with the lowest latency. The company also needs automated failover between Regions.  
Which solution will meet these requirements?

- A. Deploy a Network Load Balancer (NLB) and an associated target group. Associate the target group with the Auto Scaling group. Use the NLB as an AWS Global Accelerator endpoint in each Region.
- B. Deploy an Application Load Balancer (ALB) and an associated target group. Associate the target group with the Auto Scaling group. Use the ALB as an AWS Global Accelerator endpoint in each Region.
- C. Deploy a Network Load Balancer (NLB) and an associated target group. Associate the target group with the Auto Scaling group. Create an Amazon Route 53 latency record that points to aliases for each NLB. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution that uses the latency record as an origin.
- D. Deploy an Application Load Balancer (ALB) and an associated target group. Associate the target group with the Auto Scaling group. Create an Amazon Route 53 weighted record that points to aliases for each ALB. Deploy an Amazon CloudFront distribution that uses the weighted record as an origin.

A - Global Accelerator is a good fit for non-HTTP use cases, such as gaming (UDP), IoT (MQTT), or Voice over IP, as well as for HTTP use cases that specifically require static IP addresses or deterministic, fast regional failover. Both services integrate with AWS Shield for DDoS protection.

A company runs an online marketplace web application on AWS. The application serves hundreds of thousands of users during peak hours. The company needs a scalable, near-real-time solution to share the details of millions of financial transactions with several other internal applications. Transactions also need to be processed to remove sensitive data before being stored in a document database for low-latency retrieval.  
What should a solutions architect recommend to meet these requirements?

- A. Store the transactions data into Amazon DynamoDB. Set up a rule in DynamoDB to remove sensitive data from every transaction upon write. Use DynamoDB Streams to share the transactions data with other applications.
- B. Stream the transactions data into Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose to store data in Amazon DynamoDB and Amazon S3. Use AWS Lambda integration with Kinesis Data Firehose to remove sensitive data. Other applications can consume the data stored in Amazon S3.
- C. Stream the transactions data into Amazon Kinesis Data Streams. Use AWS Lambda integration to remove sensitive data from every transaction and then store the transactions data in Amazon DynamoDB. Other applications can consume the transactions data off the Kinesis data stream.
- D. Store the batched transactions data in Amazon S3 as files. Use AWS Lambda to process every file and remove sensitive data before updating the files in Amazon S3. The Lambda function then stores the data in Amazon DynamoDB. Other applications can consume transaction files stored in Amazon S3.

whole data for process and sensitive data removed data for storage

Stream is used if you want real time results , but with firehose , you generally use the data at a later point of time by storing it somewhere. Hence if you see "REAL TIME" the answer is most probably Kinesis Data Streams.
Kinesis Data Firehose can set up stream destination of many AWS Services

A company is preparing to launch a public-facing web application in the AWS Cloud. The architecture consists of Amazon EC2 instances within a VPC behind an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB). A third-party service is used for the DNS. The company's solutions architect must recommend a solution to detect and protect against large-scale DDoS attacks.  
Which solution meets these requirements?

- A. Enable Amazon GuardDuty on the account.
- B. Enable Amazon Inspector on the EC2 instances.
- C. Enable AWS Shield and assign Amazon Route 53 to it.
- D. Enable AWS Shield Advanced and assign the ELB to it.

1. C is incorrect because question says Third party DNS and route 53 is AWS proprietary
2. AWS Shield Advanced provides expanded DDoS attack protection for your Amazon EC2 instances, Elastic Load Balancing load balancers, CloudFront distributions, Route 53 hosted zones, and AWS Global Accelerator standard accelerators.
3. Shield Advanced is the only tier that can protect EC2 which is not possible in Standard.

### 36
A company is building an application in the AWS Cloud. The application will store data in Amazon S3 buckets in two AWS Regions. The company must use an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer managed key to encrypt all data that is stored in the S3 buckets. The data in both S3 buckets must be encrypted and decrypted with the same KMS key. The data and the key must be stored in each of the two Regions.  
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?

- A. Create an S3 bucket in each Region. Configure the S3 buckets to use server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). Configure replication between the S3 buckets.
- B. Create a customer managed multi-Region KMS key. Create an S3 bucket in each Region. Configure replication between the S3 buckets. Configure the application to use the KMS key with client-side encryption.
- C. Create a customer managed KMS key and an S3 bucket in each Region. Configure the S3 buckets to use server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). Configure replication between the S3 buckets.
- D. Create a customer managed KMS key and an S3 bucket in each Region. Configure the S3 buckets to use server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS). Configure replication between the S3 buckets.

**B. Create a customer managed multi-Region KMS key. Create an S3 bucket in each Region. Configure replication between the S3 buckets. Configure the application to use the KMS key with client-side encryption.**
- **Multi-Region KMS key**: This ensures the **same key** is available in both regions.
- **Client-side encryption**: Allows the application to encrypt and decrypt data before uploading or retrieving it from S3, using the same KMS key.
- **Reduced operational overhead**: With a multi-Region KMS key, key management is simpler since the key is synchronized across both regions.

- **Option A:** Uses **SSE-S3** (Amazon S3 managed keys) but doesn’t meet the requirement of using a **customer managed KMS key**.
- **Option C:** Creates **two separate KMS keys**, one for each region, but this does not meet the requirement to use the **same key** across regions.
- **Option D:** While it uses **SSE-KMS** (KMS-backed encryption), it requires two separate KMS keys (one in each region) and thus increases operational overhead. Managing multiple keys adds complexity.

A company recently launched a variety of new workloads on Amazon EC2 instances in its AWS account. The company needs to create a strategy to access and administer the instances remotely and securely. The company needs to implement a repeatable process that works with native AWS services and follows the AWS Well-Architected Framework.  
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?

- A. Use the EC2 serial console to directly access the terminal interface of each instance for administration.
- B. Attach the appropriate IAM role to each existing instance and new instance. Use AWS Systems Manager Session Manager to establish a remote SSH session.
- C. Create an administrative SSH key pair. Load the public key into each EC2 instance. Deploy a bastion host in a public subnet to provide a tunnel for administration of each instance.
- D. Establish an AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection. Instruct administrators to use their local on-premises machines to connect directly to the instances by using SSH keys across the VPN tunnel.

A company maintains a searchable repository of items on its website. The data is stored in an Amazon RDS for MySQL database table that contains more than 10 million rows. The database has 2 TB of General Purpose SSD storage. There are millions of updates against this data every day through the company's website.  
The company has noticed that some insert operations are taking 10 seconds or longer. The company has determined that the database storage performance is the problem.  
Which solution addresses this performance issue?

- A. Change the storage type to Provisioned IOPS SSD.
- B. Change the DB instance to a memory optimized instance class.
- C. Change the DB instance to a burstable performance instance class.
- D. Enable Multi-AZ RDS read replicas with MySQL native asynchronous replication.

A: Made for high levels of I/O opps for consistent, predictable performance.
B: Can improve performance of insert opps, but it's a storage performance rather than processing power problem
C: for moderate CPU usage
D: for scale read-only replicas and doesn't improve performance of insert opps on the primary DB instance

A company has thousands of edge devices that collectively generate 1 TB of status alerts each day. Each alert is approximately 2 KB in size. A solutions architect needs to implement a solution to ingest and store the alerts for future analysis.  
The company wants a highly available solution. However, the company needs to minimize costs and does not want to manage additional infrastructure. Additionally, the company wants to keep 14 days of data available for immediate analysis and archive any data older than 14 days.  
What is the MOST operationally efficient solution that meets these requirements?

- A. Create an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream to ingest the alerts. Configure the Kinesis Data Firehose stream to deliver the alerts to an Amazon S3 bucket. Set up an S3 Lifecycle configuration to transition data to Amazon S3 Glacier after 14 days.
- B. Launch Amazon EC2 instances across two Availability Zones and place them behind an Elastic Load Balancer to ingest the alerts. Create a script on the EC2 instances that will store the alerts in an Amazon S3 bucket. Set up an S3 Lifecycle configuration to transition data to Amazon S3 Glacier after 14 days.
- C. Create an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream to ingest the alerts. Configure the Kinesis Data Firehose stream to deliver the alerts to an Amazon OpenSearch Service (Amazon Elasticsearch Service) cluster. Set up the Amazon OpenSearch Service (Amazon Elasticsearch Service) cluster to take manual snapshots every day and delete data from the cluster that is older than 14 days.
- D. Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) standard queue to ingest the alerts, and set the message retention period to 14 days. Configure consumers to poll the SQS queue, check the age of the message, and analyze the message data as needed. If the message is 14 days old, the consumer should copy the message to an Amazon S3 bucket and delete the message from the SQS queue.

A company's application integrates with multiple software-as-a-service (SaaS) sources for data collection. The company runs Amazon EC2 instances to receive the data and to upload the data to an Amazon S3 bucket for analysis. The same EC2 instance that receives and uploads the data also sends a notification to the user when an upload is complete. The company has noticed slow application performance and wants to improve the performance as much as possible.  
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?

- A. Create an Auto Scaling group so that EC2 instances can scale out. Configure an S3 event notification to send events to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic when the upload to the S3 bucket is complete.
- B. Create an[[AppFlow]] flow to transfer data between each SaaS source and the S3 bucket. Configure an S3 event notification to send events to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic when the upload to the S3 bucket is complete.
- C. Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule for each SaaS source to send output data. Configure the S3 bucket as the rule's target. Create a second EventBridge (Cloud Watch Events) rule to send events when the upload to the S3 bucket is complete. Configure an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic as the second rule's target.
- D. Create a Docker container to use instead of an EC2 instance. Host the containerized application on Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS). Configure Amazon CloudWatch Container Insights to send events to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic when the upload to the S3 bucket is complete.

Deploying a gateway VPC endpoint for Amazon S3 is the most cost-effective way for the company to avoid Regional data transfer charges. A gateway VPC endpoint is a network gateway that allows communication between instances in a VPC and a service, such as Amazon S3, without requiring an Internet gateway or a NAT device. Data transfer between the VPC and the service through a gateway VPC endpoint is free of charge, while data transfer between the VPC and the Internet through an Internet gateway or NAT device is subject to data transfer charges. By using a gateway VPC endpoint, the company can reduce its data transfer costs by eliminating the need to transfer data through the NAT gateway to access Amazon S3. This option would provide the required connectivity to Amazon S3 and minimize data transfer charges.


C, privately connects VPC to aws services via privatelink. Doesn't require nat gateway, vpn or direct connect. Data doesn't leave amazon network so there are no data transfer charges A, used to enable instances in private subnets to connect to internet or aws services, data transfered is charged B, similar to nat gateway D, not related to data transfer

### 42
A company runs a highly available image-processing application on Amazon EC2 instances in a single VPC. The EC2 instances run inside several subnets across multiple Availability Zones. The EC2 instances do not communicate with each other. However, the EC2 instances download images from Amazon S3 and upload images to Amazon S3 through a single NAT gateway. The company is concerned about data transfer charges.  
What is the MOST cost-effective way for the company to avoid Regional data transfer charges?

- A. Launch the NAT gateway in each Availability Zone.
- B. Replace the NAT gateway with a NAT instance.
- C. Deploy a gateway VPC endpoint for Amazon S3.
- D. Provision an EC2 Dedicated Host to run the EC2 instances.

### 43
A company has an on-premises application that generates a large amount of time-sensitive data that is backed up to Amazon S3. The application has grown and there are user complaints about internet bandwidth limitations. A solutions architect needs to design a long-term solution that allows for both timely backups to Amazon S3 and with minimal impact on internet connectivity for internal users.  
Which solution meets these requirements?

- A. Establish AWS VPN connections and proxy all traffic through a VPC gateway endpoint.
- B. Establish a new AWS Direct Connect connection and direct backup traffic through this new connection.
- C. Order daily AWS Snowball devices. Load the data onto the Snowball devices and return the devices to AWS each day.
- D. Submit a support ticket through the AWS Management Console. Request the removal of S3 service limits from the account.

### 44
A company has an Amazon S3 bucket that contains critical data. The company must protect the data from accidental deletion.  
Which combination of steps should a solutions architect take to meet these requirements? (Choose two.)

- A. Enable versioning on the S3 bucket.
- B. Enable MFA Delete on the S3 bucket.
- C. Create a bucket policy on the S3 bucket.
- D. Enable default encryption on the S3 bucket.
- E. Create a lifecycle policy for the objects in the S3 bucket.

To prevent or mitigate future accidental deletions, consider the following features:

Enable versioning to ==keep historical version==s of an object. -> prevent physical deletion
Enable Cross-Region Replication of objects.
Enable MFA delete to require multi-factor authentication (MFA) when deleting an object version.

### 45
A company has a data ingestion workflow that consists of the following:  
• An Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic for notifications about new data deliveries  
• An AWS Lambda function to process the data and ==record metadata== 
The company observes that the ingestion workflow fails occasionally because of network connectivity issues. When such a failure occurs, the Lambda function does not ingest the corresponding data unless the company manually reruns the job.  
Which combination of actions should a solutions architect take to ensure that the Lambda function ingests all data in the future? (Choose two.)

- A. Deploy the Lambda function in multiple Availability Zones.
- B. Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue, and subscribe it to the SNS topic.
- C. Increase the CPU and memory that are allocated to the Lambda function.
- D. Increase provisioned throughput for the Lambda function.
- E. Modify the Lambda function to read from an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue.

A, C, D options are out, since Lambda is fully managed service which provides high availability and scalability by its own
SQS read SNS msg immediatelly, not data loss when internet down. 


**Issue:** If the Lambda invocation fails due to network issues or transient failures (like timeouts), SNS will attempt to invoke the Lambda function again **a few times**. But if these retries fail, the message is **dropped**, and the data isn't ingested.


**SNS to Lambda:**
- **Direct invocation:** SNS sends a message directly to a Lambda function via an HTTP-based request.
- If the **network connectivity** between SNS and Lambda has problems (e.g., temporary outages or timeouts), the message might fail to be delivered.
- SNS will attempt **retries** for a short period, but if all retries fail, the message is **dropped**

**SNS publishing to SQS is different:** When SNS sends a message to SQS, it uses **internal AWS infrastructure** to deliver it.
- This means SNS and SQS operate on the **same network backbone** within AWS.
- As a result, **transient external network issues** (e.g., issues between the internet and AWS) won’t impact SNS's ability to publish messages to SQS.

A company has an application that provides marketing services to stores. The services are based on previous purchases by store customers. The stores upload transaction data to the company through SFTP, and the data is processed and analyzed to generate new marketing offers. Some of the files can exceed 200 GB in size.  
Recently, the company discovered that some of the stores have uploaded files that contain personally identifiable information (PII) that should not have been included. The company wants administrators to be alerted if PII is shared again. The company also wants to automate remediation.  
What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements with the LEAST development effort?

- A. Use an Amazon S3 bucket as a secure transfer point. Use Amazon Inspector to scan the objects in the bucket. If objects contain PII, trigger an S3 Lifecycle policy to remove the objects that contain PII.
- B. Use an Amazon S3 bucket as a secure transfer point. Use Amazon Macie to scan the objects in the bucket. If objects contain PII, use Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) to trigger a notification to the administrators to remove the objects that contain PII.
- C. Implement custom scanning algorithms in an AWS Lambda function. Trigger the function when objects are loaded into the bucket. If objects contain PII, use Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) to trigger a notification to the administrators to remove the objects that contain PII.
- D. Implement custom scanning algorithms in an AWS Lambda function. Trigger the function when objects are loaded into the bucket. If objects contain PII, use Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES) to trigger a notification to the administrators and trigger an S3 Lifecycle policy to remove the meats that contain PII.

A company needs guaranteed Amazon EC2 capacity in three specific Availability Zones in a specific AWS Region for an upcoming event that will last 1 week.  
What should the company do to guarantee the EC2 capacity?

- A. Purchase Reserved Instances that specify the Region needed.
- B. Create an On-Demand Capacity Reservation that specifies the Region needed.
- C. Purchase Reserved Instances that specify the Region and three Availability Zones needed.
- D. Create an On-Demand Capacity Reservation that specifies the Region and three Availability Zones needed.

Reserved instances are for long term(require a fixed one-year or three-year commitment.) 

An On-Demand Capacity Reservation is a type of Amazon EC2 reservation that enables you to create and manage reserved capacity on Amazon EC2. With an On-Demand Capacity Reservation, you can specify the Region and Availability Zones where you want to reserve capacity, and the number of EC2 instances you want to reserve. This allows you to guarantee capacity in specific Availability Zones in a specific Region.

***WRONG***
Option A, purchasing Reserved Instances that specify the Region needed, would not guarantee capacity in specific Availability Zones.
Option B, creating an On-Demand Capacity Reservation that specifies the Region needed, would not guarantee capacity in specific Availability Zones.
Option C, purchasing Reserved Instances that specify the Region and three Availability Zones needed, would not guarantee capacity in specific Availability Zones as Reserved Instances do not provide capacity reservations.

A company stores call transcript files on a monthly basis. Users access the files randomly within 1 year of the call, but users access the files infrequently after 1 year. The company wants to optimize its solution by giving users the ability to query and retrieve files that are less than 1-year-old as quickly as possible. A delay in retrieving older files is acceptable.  
Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?

- A. Store individual files with tags in Amazon S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval. Query the tags to retrieve the files from S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval.
- B. Store individual files in Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering. Use S3 Lifecycle policies to move the files to [[S3#Storage class|S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval]] after 1 year. Query and retrieve the files that are in Amazon S3 by using Amazon Athena. Query and retrieve the files that are in S3 Glacier by using S3 Glacier Select.
- C. Store individual files with tags in Amazon S3 Standard storage. Store search metadata for each archive in Amazon S3 Standard storage. Use S3 Lifecycle policies to move the files to S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval after 1 year. Query and retrieve the files by searching for metadata from Amazon S3.
- D. Store individual files in Amazon S3 Standard storage. Use S3 Lifecycle policies to move the files to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 1 year. Store search metadata in Amazon RDS. Query the files from Amazon RDS. Retrieve the files from S3 Glacier Deep Archive.

Users access the files randomly
S3 Intelligent-Tiering is the ideal storage class for data with unknown, changing, or unpredictable access patterns, independent of object size or retention period.

A company has a production workload that runs on 1,000 Amazon EC2 Linux instances. The workload is powered by third-party software. The company needs to patch the third-party software on all EC2 instances as quickly as possible to remediate a critical security vulnerability.  
What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?

- A. Create an AWS Lambda function to apply the patch to all EC2 instances.
- B. Configure AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to apply the patch to all EC2 instances.
- C. Schedule an AWS Systems Manager maintenance window to apply the patch to all EC2 instances.
- D. Use AWS Systems Manager Run Command to run a custom command that applies the patch to all EC2 instances.


The primary focus of Patch Manager, a capability of AWS Systems Manager, is on installing operating systems security-related updates on managed nodes. By default, Patch Manager doesn't install all available patches, but rather a smaller set of patches focused on security.

A company has registered its domain name with Amazon Route 53. The company uses Amazon API Gateway in the ca-central-1 Region as a public interface for its backend microservice APIs. Third-party services consume the APIs securely. The company wants to design its API Gateway URL with the company's domain name and corresponding certificate so that the third-party services can use HTTPS.  
Which solution will meet these requirements?

- A. Create stage variables in API Gateway with Name="Endpoint-URL" and Value="Company Domain Name" to overwrite the default URL. Import the public certificate associated with the company's domain name into AWS Certificate Manager (ACM).
- B. Create Route 53 DNS records with the company's domain name. Point the alias record to the Regional API Gateway stage endpoint. Import the public certificate associated with the company's domain name into AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) in the us-east-1 Region.
- C. Create a Regional API Gateway endpoint. Associate the API Gateway endpoint with the company's domain name. Import the public certificate associated with the company's domain name into AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) in the same Region. ==Attach the certificate to the API Gateway endpoint.== Configure Route 53 to route traffic to the API Gateway endpoint.
- D. Create a Regional API Gateway endpoint. Associate the API Gateway endpoint with the company's domain name. Import the public certificate associated with the company's domain name into AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) in the us-east-1 Region. Attach the certificate to the API Gateway APIs. Create Route 53 DNS records with the company's domain name. Point an A record to the company's domain name.


Options A and D do not include the necessary steps to associate the API Gateway endpoint with the company's domain name and attach the certificate to the endpoint.
Option B includes the necessary steps to associate the API Gateway endpoint with the company's domain name and attach the certificate, but it imports the certificate into the us-east-1 Region instead of the ca-central-1 Region where the API Gateway is located.



To design the API Gateway URL with the company's domain name and corresponding certificate, the company needs to do the following:

1. Create a Regional API Gateway endpoint: This will allow the company to create an endpoint that is specific to a region.

2. Associate the API Gateway endpoint with the company's domain name: This will allow the company to use its own domain name for the API Gateway URL.

3. Import the public certificate associated with the company's domain name into AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) in the same Region: This will allow the company to use HTTPS for secure communication with its APIs.

4. Attach the certificate to the API Gateway endpoint: This will allow the company to use the certificate for securing the API Gateway URL.

5. Configure Route 53 to route traffic to the API Gateway endpoint: This will allow the company to use Route 53 to route traffic to the API Gateway URL using the company's domain name.

A company hosts more than 300 global websites and applications. The company requires a platform to analyze more than 30 TB of clickstream data each day.  
What should a solutions architect do to transmit and process the clickstream data?

- A. Design an AWS Data Pipeline to archive the data to an Amazon S3 bucket and run an Amazon EMR cluster with the data to generate analytics.
- B. Create an Auto Scaling group of Amazon EC2 instances to process the data and send it to an Amazon S3 data lake for Amazon Redshift to use for analysis.
- C. Cache the data to Amazon CloudFront. Store the data in an Amazon S3 bucket. When an object is added to the S3 bucket. run an AWS Lambda function to process the data for analysis.
- D. Collect the data from Amazon Kinesis Data Streams. Use Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose to transmit the data to an Amazon S3 data lake. Load the data in Amazon Redshift for analysis.

Option A, which involves using AWS Data Pipeline to archive the data to an Amazon S3 bucket and running an [[EMR]] cluster with the data to generate analytics, is not the most appropriate solution because it does not involve real-time processing of the data.

Option B, which involves creating an Auto Scaling group of Amazon EC2 instances to process the data and sending it to an Amazon S3 data lake for Amazon Redshift to use for analysis, is not the most appropriate solution because it does not involve a fully managed service for transmitting the data from the processing layer to the data lake.

Option C, which involves caching the data to Amazon CloudFront, storing the data in an Amazon S3 bucket, and running an AWS Lambda function to process the data for analysis when an object is added to the S3 bucket, is not the most appropriate solution because it does not involve a scalable and durable service for collecting and processing the data in real-time.

Option D is the most appropriate solution for transmitting and processing the clickstream data in this scenario. Amazon Kinesis Data Streams is a highly scalable and durable service that enables real-time processing of streaming data at a high volume and high rate. You can use Kinesis Data Streams to collect and process the clickstream data in real-time. 
Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose is a fully managed service that loads streaming data into data stores and analytics tools. You can use Kinesis Data Firehose to transmit the data from Kinesis Data Streams to an Amazon S3 data lake. 
Once the data is in the data lake, you can use Amazon Redshift to load the data and perform analysis on it. 
Amazon Redshift is a fully managed, petabyte-scale data warehouse service that allows you to quickly and efficiently analyze data using SQL and your existing business intelligence tools.

A company hosts an application on multiple Amazon EC2 instances. The application processes messages from an Amazon SQS queue, writes to an Amazon RDS table, and deletes the message from the queue. Occasional duplicate records are found in the RDS table. The SQS queue does not contain any duplicate messages.  
What should a solutions architect do to ensure messages are being processed once only?

- A. Use the CreateQueue API call to create a new queue.
- B. Use the AddPermission API call to add appropriate permissions.
- C. Use the ReceiveMessage API call to set an appropriate wait time.
- D. Use the ChangeMessageVisibility API call to increase the visibility timeout.

To ensure that messages are being processed only once, a solutions architect should use the ChangeMessageVisibility API call to increase the visibility timeout which is Option D.

The visibility timeout determines the amount of time that a message received from an SQS queue is hidden from other consumers while the message is being processed. If the processing of a message takes longer than the visibility timeout, the message will become visible to other consumers and may be processed again.

A company runs a photo processing application that needs to frequently upload and download pictures from Amazon S3 buckets that are located in the same AWS Region. A solutions architect has noticed an increased cost in data transfer fees and needs to implement a solution to reduce these costs.  
How can the solutions architect meet this requirement?

- A. Deploy Amazon API Gateway into a public subnet and adjust the route table to route S3 calls through it.
- B. Deploy a NAT gateway into a public subnet and attach an endpoint policy that allows access to the S3 buckets.
- C. Deploy the application into a public subnet and allow it to route through an internet gateway to access the S3 buckets. ( internet gateway span?)
- D. Deploy an S3 VPC gateway endpoint into the VPC and attach an endpoint policy that allows access to the S3 buckets. 

Option A, deploying Amazon API Gateway into a public subnet and adjusting the route table, would not address the issue of data transfer fees as the application would still be transferring data over the internet.
> transfer fees -> transfer data over the internet

Option B, deploying a NAT gateway into a public subnet and attaching an endpoint policy, would not address the issue of data transfer fees either as the NAT gateway is used to ==enable outbound internet access for instances in a private subnet==, rather than for connecting to S3.

Option C, deploying the application into a public subnet and allowing it to route through an internet gateway, would not reduce data transfer fees as the application would still be transferring data over the internet.

The correct answer is Option D. Deploy an S3 VPC gateway endpoint into the VPC and attach an endpoint policy that allows access to the S3 buckets. By deploying an S3 VPC gateway endpoint, the application can access the S3 buckets over a private network connection within the VPC, eliminating the need for data transfer over the internet. This can help reduce data transfer fees as well as improve the performance of the application. The endpoint policy can be used to specify which S3 buckets the application has access to.

A company receives 10 TB of instrumentation data each day from several machines located at a single factory. The data consists of JSON files stored on a storage area network (SAN) in an on-premises data center located within the factory. The company wants to send this data to Amazon S3 where it can be accessed by several additional systems that provide critical near-real-time analytics. A secure transfer is important because the data is considered sensitive.  
Which solution offers the MOST reliable data transfer?

- A. AWS DataSync over public internet
- B. AWS DataSync over AWS Direct Connect
- C. AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) over public internet
- D. AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) over AWS Direct Connect

DMS is for databases and here refers to “JSON files”. Public internet is not reliable. So best option is B.

AWS DataSync is a data transfer service that uses network optimization techniques to transfer data efficiently and securely between on-premises storage systems and Amazon S3 or other storage targets. When used over AWS Direct Connect, DataSync can provide a dedicated and secure network connection between your on-premises data center and AWS. This can help to ensure a more reliable and secure data transfer compared to using the public internet.

A company needs to configure a real-time data ingestion architecture for its application. The company needs an API, a process that transforms data as the data is streamed, and a storage solution for the data.  
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?

- A. Deploy an Amazon EC2 instance to host an API that sends data to an Amazon Kinesis data stream. Create an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream that uses the Kinesis data stream as a data source. Use AWS Lambda functions to transform the data. Use the Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream to send the data to Amazon S3.
- B. Deploy an Amazon EC2 instance to host an API that sends data to AWS Glue. Stop source/destination checking on the EC2 instance. Use AWS Glue to transform the data and to send the data to Amazon S3.
- C. Configure an Amazon API Gateway API to send data to an Amazon Kinesis data stream. Create an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream that uses the Kinesis data stream as a data source. Use AWS Lambda functions to transform the data. Use the Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream to send the data to Amazon S3.
- D. Configure an Amazon API Gateway API to send data to AWS Glue. Use AWS Lambda functions to transform the data. Use AWS Glue to send the data to Amazon S3.

(A) - You don't need to deploy an EC2 instance to host an API - Operational overhead
(B) - Same as A
(**C**) - Is the answer
(D) - AWS Glue gets data from S3, not from API GW. AWS Glue could do ETL by itself, so don't need lambda. Non sense. https://aws.amazon.com/glue/
ETL stands for "==extract, transform, load=="

A company hosts its web applications in the AWS Cloud. The company configures Elastic Load Balancers to use certificates that are imported into AWS Certificate Manager (ACM). The company's security team must be notified 30 days before the expiration of each certificate.  
What should a solutions architect recommend to meet this requirement?

- A. Add a rule in ACM to publish a custom message to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic every day, beginning 30 days before any certificate will expire.
- B. Create an AWS Config rule that checks for certificates that will expire within 30 days. Configure Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) to invoke a custom alert by way of Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) when AWS Config reports a noncompliant resource.
- C. Use AWS Trusted Advisor to check for certificates that will expire within 30 days. Create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm that is based on Trusted Advisor metrics for check status changes. Configure the alarm to send a custom alert by way of Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS).
- D. Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule to detect any certificates that will expire within 30 days. Configure the rule to invoke an AWS Lambda function. Configure the Lambda function to send a custom alert by way of Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS).

https://aws.amazon.com/jp/blogs/security/how-to-monitor-expirations-of-imported-certificates-in-aws-certificate-manager-acm/#:~:text=The%20first%20of,email%20or%20SNS. The first of the two options I describe is to use the ACM built-in Certificate Expiration event, which is raised through Amazon EventBridge, to invoke a Lambda function. In this option, the function is configured to publish the result as a finding in Security Hub, and also as an SNS topic used for email subscriptions. As a result, an administrator can be notified of a specific expiring certificate, or an IT service management (ITSM) system can automatically open a case or incident through email or SNS.

A company wants to reduce the cost of its existing three-tier web architecture. The web, application, and database servers are running on Amazon EC2 instances for the development, test, and production environments. The EC2 instances average 30% CPU utilization during peak hours and 10% CPU utilization during non-peak hours.
The production EC2 instances run 24 hours a day. The development and test EC2 instances run for at least 8 hours each day. The company plans to implement automation to stop the development and test EC2 instances when they are not in use.
Which EC2 instance purchasing solution will meet the company's requirements MOST cost-effectively?

A. Use Spot Instances for the production EC2 instances. Use Reserved Instances for the development and test EC2 instances.
B. Use Reserved Instances for the production EC2 instances. Use On-Demand Instances for the development and test EC2 instances.
C. Use Spot blocks for the production EC2 instances. Use Reserved Instances for the development and test EC2 instances.
D. Use On-Demand Instances for the production EC2 instances. Use Spot blocks for the development and test EC2 instances.

Option B, would indeed be the most cost-effective solution. Reserved Instances provide cost savings for instances that run consistently, such as the production environment in this case, while On-Demand Instances offer flexibility and are suitable for instances with variable usage patterns like the development and test environments. This combination ensures cost optimization based on the specific requirements and usage patterns described in the question.

### 87
A company hosts an application on AWS Lambda functions that are invoked by an Amazon API Gateway API. The Lambda functions save customer data to an Amazon Aurora MySQL database. Whenever the company upgrades the database, the Lambda functions fail to establish database connections until the upgrade is complete. The result is that customer data is not recorded for some of the event.  
A solutions architect needs to design a solution that stores customer data that is created during database upgrades.  
Which solution will meet these requirements?

- A. Provision an Amazon RDS proxy to sit between the Lambda functions and the database. Configure the Lambda functions to connect to the RDS proxy.
- B. Increase the run time of the Lambda functions to the maximum. Create a retry mechanism in the code that stores the customer data in the database.
- C. Persist the customer data to Lambda local storage. Configure new Lambda functions to scan the local storage to save the customer data to the database.
- D. Store the customer data in an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) FIFO queue. Create a new Lambda function that polls the queue and stores the customer data in the database.

The original question was about handling a situation where the database is unavailable due to an upgrade, not a failover situation. During a database upgrade, the database instance is not available, and RDS Proxy would not be able to connect to a new database instance because there isn’t one. In this specific scenario, using Amazon SQS as described in option D provides a buffer for the incoming data during the period when the database is unavailable. This ensures that no data is lost, and it can be written to the database once the upgrade is complete.

A company runs an on-premises application that is powered by a MySQL database. The company is migrating the application to AWS to increase the application's elasticity and availability.  
The current architecture shows heavy read activity on the database during times of normal operation. Every 4 hours, the company's development team pulls a full export of the production database to populate a database in the staging environment. During this period, users experience unacceptable application latency. The development team is unable to use the staging environment until the procedure completes.  
A solutions architect must recommend replacement architecture that alleviates the application latency issue. The replacement architecture also must give the development team the ability to continue using the staging environment without delay.  
Which solution meets these requirements?

- A. Use Amazon Aurora MySQL with Multi-AZ Aurora Replicas for production. Populate the staging database by implementing a backup and restore process that uses the mysqldump utility.
- B. Use Amazon Aurora MySQL with Multi-AZ Aurora Replicas for production. Use database cloning to create the staging database on-demand.
- C. Use Amazon RDS for MySQL with a Multi-AZ deployment and read replicas for production. Use the standby instance for the staging database.
- D. Use Amazon RDS for MySQL with a Multi-AZ deployment and read replicas for production. Populate the staging database by implementing a backup and restore process that uses the mysqldump utility.

The recommended solution is Option B: Use Amazon Aurora MySQL with Multi-AZ Aurora Replicas for production. Use database cloning to create the staging database on-demand.

To alleviate the application latency issue, the recommended solution is to use Amazon Aurora MySQL with Multi-AZ Aurora Replicas for production, and use database cloning to create the staging database on-demand. This allows the development team to continue using the staging environment without delay, while also providing elasticity and availability for the production application.

Therefore, Options A, C, and D are not recommended

- **Amazon Aurora MySQL with Multi-AZ Aurora Replicas** provides high availability and performance, which is essential for handling heavy read activity.
- **Database cloning** allows for quick and easy creation of a staging database, eliminating the need for a lengthy backup and restore process. This ensures that the staging environment is always available for development and testing.
- **Multi-AZ Aurora Replicas** provide redundancy and disaster recovery, ensuring that the application remains available even in the event of a failure.

Other options don't fully address the requirements:

- **A:** Using mysqldump for backups and restores can be time-consuming and can impact application performance.
- **C:** While using the standby instance as the staging database can reduce latency, it may not be ideal for development and testing as it is a production instance.
- **D:** Similar to option A, using mysqldump for backups and restores can be time-consuming and impact application performance.
