A solutions architect is designing a VPC with public and private subnets. The VPC and subnets use IPv4 CIDR blocks. There is one public subnet and one private subnet in each of three Availability Zones (AZs) for high availability. An internet gateway is used to provide internet access for the public subnets. The private subnets require access to the internet to allow Amazon EC2 instances to download software updates.  
What should the solutions architect do to enable Internet access for the private subnets?

- A. Create three NAT gateways, one for each public subnet in each AZ. Create a private route table for each AZ that forwards non-VPC traffic to the NAT gateway in its AZ.
- B. Create three NAT instances, one for each private subnet in each AZ. Create a private route table for each AZ that forwards non-VPC traffic to the NAT instance in its AZ.
- C. Create a second internet gateway on one of the private subnets. Update the route table for the private subnets that forward non-VPC traffic to the private internet gateway.
- D. Create an egress-only internet gateway on one of the public subnets. Update the route table for the private subnets that forward non-VPC traffic to the egress-only Internet gateway.

A company wants to migrate an on-premises data center to AWS. The data center hosts an SFTP server that stores its data on an NFS-based file system. The server holds 200 GB of data that needs to be transferred. The server must be hosted on an Amazon EC2 instance that uses an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system.  
Which combination of steps should a solutions architect take to automate this task? (Choose two.)

- A. Launch the EC2 instance into the same Availability Zone as the EFS file system.
- B. Install an AWS DataSync agent in the on-premises data center.
- C. Create a secondary Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume on the EC2 instance for the data.
- D. Manually use an operating system copy command to push the data to the EC2 instance.
- E. Use AWS DataSync to create a suitable location configuration for the on-premises SFTP server.


To automate the process of transferring the data from the on-premises SFTP server to an EC2 instance with an EFS file system, you can use AWS DataSync. AWS DataSync is a fully managed data transfer service that simplifies, automates, and accelerates transferring data between on-premises storage systems and Amazon S3, Amazon EFS, or Amazon FSx for Windows File Server.

To use AWS DataSync for this task, you should first install an AWS DataSync agent in the on-premises data center. This agent is a lightweight software application that you install on your on-premises data source. The agent communicates with the AWS DataSync service to transfer data between the data source and target locations.

A company has an AWS Glue extract, transform, and load (ETL) job that runs every day at the same time. The job processes XML data that is in an Amazon S3 bucket. New data is added to the S3 bucket every day. A solutions architect notices that AWS Glue is processing all the data during each run.  
What should the solutions architect do to prevent AWS Glue from reprocessing old data?

- A. Edit the job to use job bookmarks.
- B. Edit the job to delete data after the data is processed.
- C. Edit the job by setting the NumberOfWorkers field to 1.
- D. Use a FindMatches machine learning (ML) transform.

A
This is the purpose of bookmarks: "AWS Glue tracks data that has already been processed during a previous run of an ETL job by persisting state information from the job run. This persisted state information is called a job bookmark

### 107
A bicycle sharing company is developing a multi-tier architecture to track the location of its bicycles during peak operating hours. The company wants to use these data points in its existing analytics platform. A solutions architect must determine the most viable multi-tier option to support this architecture. The data points must be accessible from the REST API.  
Which action meets these requirements for storing and retrieving location data?

- A. Use Amazon Athena with Amazon S3.
- B. Use Amazon API Gateway with AWS Lambda.
- C. Use Amazon QuickSight with Amazon Redshift.
- D. Use Amazon API Gateway with Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics.

The correct answer is:

**D. Use Amazon API Gateway with Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics.**

Explanation:
Let’s analyze the requirements:

1. **Track real-time bicycle locations**: This suggests that the company needs a solution capable of ingesting, processing, and analyzing streaming data quickly.
2. **Multi-tier architecture**: This involves multiple layers, such as ingestion, processing, storage, and analytics.
3. **Data should be accessible from a REST API**: This means the solution should expose endpoints that allow access to data in near real-time for external applications or users.
4. **Integration with analytics platform**: Data points need to be continuously sent to an analytics system, indicating a preference for a service that supports streaming data with minimal latency.

**Option Analysis:**

- **A. Use Amazon Athena with Amazon S3**:  
   - **Athena** is a query engine used to analyze data stored in **S3**.  
   - This is not ideal for tracking real-time locations, as it is more suited for querying static, historical data.
   - It doesn’t support **real-time analytics or data streaming** directly.

- **B. Use Amazon API Gateway with AWS Lambda**:  
   - API Gateway with Lambda can provide a REST API interface, but Lambda functions are better suited for processing **event-based requests** rather than continuously streaming real-time data.
   - It wouldn’t handle high-frequency, real-time data ingestion and processing as efficiently as a **streaming solution** like Kinesis.

- **C. Use Amazon QuickSight with Amazon Redshift**:  
   - Redshift is a **data warehouse**, suitable for querying large datasets but **not designed for real-time data ingestion**.  
   - QuickSight is used for building **dashboards and visualizations**, not for tracking real-time locations.

- **D. Use Amazon API Gateway with Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics**:  
   - **API Gateway** can expose REST API endpoints for retrieving location data.
   - **Kinesis Data Analytics** can process the **real-time stream of location data** as it is ingested through **Kinesis Data Streams** or **Kinesis Firehose**.
   - This combination allows the company to perform **real-time analytics** and expose relevant insights through the REST API, which fits the requirements perfectly.

### 108

A company has an automobile sales website that stores its listings in a database on Amazon RDS. When an automobile is sold, the listing needs to be removed from the website and the data must be sent to multiple target systems.  
Which design should a solutions architect recommend?

- A. Create an AWS Lambda function triggered when the database on Amazon RDS is updated to send the information to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue for the targets to consume.
- B. Create an AWS Lambda function triggered when the database on Amazon RDS is updated to send the information to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) FIFO queue for the targets to consume.
- C. Subscribe to an RDS event notification and send an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue fanned out to multiple Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topics. Use AWS Lambda functions to update the targets.
- D. Subscribe to an RDS event notification and send an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic fanned out to multiple Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queues. Use AWS Lambda functions to update the targets.


The correct answer is:  A

---
**Explanation:**

The problem describes a **real-time trigger** system where:
1. **Database updates (listing removal) should trigger actions**.
2. **Multiple target systems** must receive the data.

 B
- A **FIFO queue** enforces strict ordering, which adds unnecessary complexity unless order is a strict requirement (not mentioned here).
- **Standard SQS** queues are typically preferred for decoupling with multiple consumers.

- **C. 
- This introduces **unnecessary complexity** by adding multiple SNS topics.  
- The direct use of SQS queues for each target is simpler and more appropriate.

- **D. 
- This approach relies on **RDS event notifications**, but these notifications are **limited** and may not trigger on all types of data changes.
- The **Lambda + SQS** design in Option A is a more **reliable and straightforward** way to trigger actions based on **data changes**.


### 109
A company needs to store data in Amazon S3 and must prevent the data from being changed. The company wants new objects that are uploaded to Amazon S3 to remain unchangeable for a nonspecific amount of time until the company decides to modify the objects. Only specific users in the company's AWS account can have the ability 10 delete the objects.  
What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?

- A. Create an S3 Glacier vault. Apply a write-once, read-many (WORM) vault lock policy to the objects.
- B. Create an S3 bucket with S3 Object Lock enabled. Enable versioning. Set a retention period of 100 years. Use governance mode as the S3 bucket’s default retention mode for new objects.
- C. Create an S3 bucket. Use AWS CloudTrail to track any S3 API events that modify the objects. Upon notification, restore the modified objects from any backup versions that the company has.
- D. Create an S3 bucket with S3 Object Lock enabled. Enable versioning. Add a legal hold to the objects. Add the s3:PutObjectLegalHold permission to the IAM policies of users who need to delete the objects.

retention period:
the length of time that information or records are kept, regardless of their format.

"The Object Lock legal hold operation enables you to place a legal hold on an object version. Like setting a retention period, a legal hold prevents an object version from being overwritten or deleted. However, a legal hold doesn't have an associated retention period and remains in effect until removed."

A social media company allows users to upload images to its website. The website runs on Amazon EC2 instances. During upload requests, the website resizes the images to a standard size and stores the resized images in Amazon S3. Users are experiencing slow upload requests to the website.  
The company needs to reduce coupling within the application and improve website performance. A solutions architect must design the most operationally efficient process for image uploads.  
Which combination of actions should the solutions architect take to meet these requirements? (Choose two.)

- A. Configure the application to upload images to S3 Glacier.
- B. Configure the web server to upload the original images to Amazon S3.
- C. Configure the application to upload images directly from each user's browser to Amazon S3 through the use of a presigned URL
- D. Configure S3 Event Notifications to invoke an AWS Lambda function when an image is uploaded. Use the function to resize the image.
- E. Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that invokes an AWS Lambda function on a schedule to resize uploaded images.


A user who does not have AWS credentials to upload a file can use a presigned URL to perform the upload. https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/s3-presigned-urls.html

Option B, Configuring the webserver to upload the original images to Amazon S3, is not a recommended solution as it would not reduce coupling within the application or improve performance.

A company hosts a containerized web application on a fleet of on-premises servers that process incoming requests. The number of requests is growing quickly. The on-premises servers cannot handle the increased number of requests. The company wants to move the application to AWS with minimum code changes and minimum development effort.  
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?

- A. Use AWS Fargate on Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) to run the containerized web application with Service Auto Scaling. Use an Application Load Balancer to distribute the incoming requests.
- B. Use two Amazon EC2 instances to host the containerized web application. Use an Application Load Balancer to distribute the incoming requests.
- C. Use AWS Lambda with a new code that uses one of the supported languages. Create multiple Lambda functions to support the load. Use Amazon API Gateway as an entry point to the Lambda functions.
- D. Use a high performance computing (HPC) solution such as AWS ParallelCluster to establish an HPC cluster that can process the incoming requests at the appropriate scale.

A company uses 50 TB of data for reporting. The company wants to move this data from on premises to AWS. A custom application in the company’s data center runs a weekly data transformation job. The company plans to pause the application until the data transfer is complete and needs to begin the transfer process as soon as possible.  
The data center does not have any available network bandwidth for additional workloads. A solutions architect must transfer the data and must configure the transformation job to continue to run in the AWS Cloud.  
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?

- A. Use AWS DataSync to move the data. Create a custom transformation job by using AWS Glue.
- B. Order an AWS Snowcone device to move the data. Deploy the transformation application to the device.
- C. Order an AWS Snowball Edge Storage Optimized device. Copy the data to the device. Create a custom transformation job by using AWS Glue.
- D. Order an AWS Snowball Edge Storage Optimized device that includes Amazon EC2 compute. Copy the data to the device. Create a new EC2 instance on AWS to run the transformation application.

AWS Snowcone
1. Deploy ultra-portable data transfer and edge computing devices anywhere
2. Collect and process data, transfer with AWS DataSync, or ship the device with data to AWS for offline transfer.


A. Use AWS DataSync to move the data. Create a custom transformation job by using AWS Glue. - No BW available for DataSync, so "asap" will be weeks/months (?)
B. Order an AWS Snowcone device to move the data. Deploy the transformation application to the device. - ==Snowcone will just store 14T==B (SSD configuration).
**C**. Order an AWS Snowball Edge Storage Optimized device. Copy the data to the device. Create a custom transformation job by using AWS Glue. - SnowBall can store 80TB (ok), takes around 1 week to move the device (faster than A), and AWS Glue allows to do ETL jobs. This is the answer.
D. Order an AWS Snowball Edge Storage Optimized device that includes Amazon EC2 compute. Copy the data to the device. Create a new EC2 instance on AWS to run the transformation application. - Same as C, but the ETL job requires the deployment/configuration/maintenance of an EC2 instance, while Glue is serverless. This means D has more operational overhead than C.

A global company is using Amazon API Gateway to design REST APIs for its loyalty club users in the us-east-1 Region and the ap-southeast-2 Region. A solutions architect must design a solution to protect these API Gateway managed REST APIs across multiple accounts from SQL injection and cross-site scripting attacks.  
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST amount of administrative effort?

- A. Set up AWS WAF in both Regions. Associate Regional web ACLs with an API stage.
- B. Set up AWS Firewall Manager in both Regions. Centrally configure AWS WAF rules.
- C. Set up AWS Shield in bath Regions. Associate Regional web ACLs with an API stage.
- D. Set up AWS Shield in one of the Regions. Associate Regional web ACLs with an API stage.
 **Option A: Set up AWS WAF in both Regions. Associate Regional web ACLs with an API stage.**

- **AWS WAF** is a **web application firewall** that protects web applications from security threats, including SQL injection and XSS.
- You need to configure **Regional web ACLs** because API Gateway is a **Regional service**.
- This solution aligns well with the requirement to protect REST APIs in **multiple regions** (us-east-1 and ap-southeast-2).
- Associating **web ACLs with API Gateway stages** ensures fine-grained protection at the API level.
- **Least administrative effort**: WAF rules are easy to set up, and AWS WAF has built-in managed rules for SQL injection and XSS attacks.

Thus, **this is the correct and most straightforward solution**.

 **Option B: Set up AWS Firewall Manager in both Regions. Centrally configure AWS WAF rules.**

- **AWS Firewall Manager** helps centrally manage firewall rules across multiple accounts and regions.
- While it simplifies rule management, it is more relevant for managing multiple security policies across **multiple AWS accounts** and services (like WAF, Shield, and Security Groups).
- For this scenario, the use of Firewall Manager introduces **unnecessary overhead**, as the primary goal is just API-level protection within a specific scope (multiple regions, not complex multi-account setups).

A company has implemented a self-managed DNS solution on three Amazon EC2 instances behind a Network Load Balancer (NLB) in the us-west-2 Region. Most of the company's users are located in the United States and Europe. The company wants to improve the performance and availability of the solution. The company launches and configures three EC2 instances in the eu-west-1 Region and adds the EC2 instances as targets for a new NLB.  
Which solution can the company use to route traffic to all the EC2 instances?

- A. Create an Amazon Route 53 geolocation routing policy to route requests to one of the two NLBs. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution. Use the Route 53 record as the distribution’s origin.
- B. Create a standard accelerator in AWS Global Accelerator. Create endpoint groups in us-west-2 and eu-west-1. Add the two NLBs as endpoints for the endpoint groups.
- C. Attach Elastic IP addresses to the six EC2 instances. Create an Amazon Route 53 geolocation routing policy to route requests to one of the six EC2 instances. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution. Use the Route 53 record as the distribution's origin.
- D. Replace the two NLBs with two Application Load Balancers (ALBs). Create an Amazon Route 53 latency routing policy to route requests to one of the two ALBs. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution. Use the Route 53 record as the distribution’s origin.

B is the correct one for self manage DNS If need to use Route53, ALB (layar 7 ) needs to be used as end points for 2 reginal x 3 EC2s, if it the case answer would be the option 4
Ans B - "AWS Global Accelerator improves the availability and performance of your applications for global users by routing traffic to the optimal endpoint based on performance and policies."


- **AWS Global Accelerator** provides **improved performance and availability** by directing users to the closest healthy endpoint (in this case, the Network Load Balancers in **us-west-2** and **eu-west-1**).
- Global Accelerator leverages **AWS’s global network**, which reduces latency and ensures traffic is routed through the most efficient paths.
- **Endpoint groups** in **Global Accelerator** allow the company to distribute traffic across NLBs in multiple regions, ensuring high availability.
- It also provides **failover capability**, sending traffic to the healthy region if one region becomes unavailable.

This solution aligns with the requirements to route traffic across multiple regions, while improving **performance** and **availability** for users in the US and Europe.

NLB 本身就是一个endPoint

the Domain Name System (DNS) uses TCP in addition to UDP: 
UDP is default: DNS uses UDP by default, but switches to TCP when UDP is unable to communicate. 

 **A. Route 53 geolocation routing policy + CloudFront distribution**

- **Geolocation routing** directs traffic based on the user’s location, but it does not consider **performance** or **availability** as effectively as Global Accelerator.
- CloudFront helps cache and distribute static content, but it doesn’t manage regional EC2 instances or load balancing directly.
- This approach doesn’t optimize real-time DNS performance for users in different regions as effectively as Global Accelerator.

 **C. Elastic IP addresses + Route 53 geolocation policy + CloudFront**

- Using **Elastic IPs for EC2 instances** directly is not scalable or reliable, as EC2 instances behind NLBs are more resilient.
- **Geolocation routing** won’t offer as dynamic and efficient routing as **Global Accelerator**.
- Again, CloudFront is useful for static content but does not enhance the performance of DNS-based traffic to EC2 instances.

 **D. Replace NLBs with ALBs + Route 53 latency routing policy + CloudFront**

- **Application Load Balancers (ALBs)** are optimized for HTTP/HTTPS traffic, but DNS services typically use **UDP or TCP**, which **NLBs** handle better.
- While **Route 53 latency routing** can help with performance, it lacks the **failover and traffic acceleration** capabilities that **Global Accelerator** offers.
- CloudFront isn't needed here since the focus is on optimizing DNS traffic, not delivering static content.

A company is running an online transaction processing (OLTP) workload on AWS. This workload uses an unencrypted Amazon RDS DB instance in a Multi-AZ deployment. Daily database snapshots are taken from this instance.  
What should a solutions architect do to ensure the database and snapshots are always encrypted moving forward?

- A. Encrypt a copy of the latest DB snapshot. Replace existing DB instance by restoring the encrypted snapshot.
- B. Create a new encrypted Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume and copy the snapshots to it. Enable encryption on the DB instance.
- C. Copy the snapshots and enable encryption using AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) Restore encrypted snapshot to an existing DB instance.
- D. Copy the snapshots to an Amazon S3 bucket that is encrypted using server-side encryption with AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) managed keys (SSE-KMS).

"You can enable encryption for an Amazon RDS DB instance when you create it, but not after it's created. However, you can add encryption to an unencrypted DB instance by creating a snapshot of your DB instance, and then creating an encrypted copy of that snapshot. You can then restore a DB instance from the encrypted snapshot to get an encrypted copy of your original DB instance."

- A. Create a new SSL certificate using AWS Certificate Manager (ACM). Install the ACM certificate on each instance.
- B. Create an Amazon S3 bucket Migrate the SSL certificate to the S3 bucket. Configure the EC2 instances to reference the bucket for SSL termination.
- C. Create another EC2 instance as a proxy server. Migrate the SSL certificate to the new instance and configure it to direct connections to the existing EC2 instances.
- D. Import the SSL certificate into AWS Certificate Manager (ACM). Create an Application Load Balancer with an HTTPS listener that uses the SSL certificate from ACM.

> **SSL termination** is the process of **decrypting incoming SSL/TLS traffic** at a load balancer, proxy server, or firewall, before passing it to backend servers in **plain text** (unencrypted).

D

This issue is solved by SSL offloading, i.e. by moving the SSL termination task to the ALB.

[AWS Elastic Load Balancing: Support for SSL Termination](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/elastic-load-balancer-support-for-ssl-termination/)

>You can now create a highly scalable, load-balanced web site using multiple Amazon EC2 instances, and you can easily arrange for the entire [HTTPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Secure) encryption and decryption process (generally known as SSL termination) to be handled by an [Elastic Load Balancer](http://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/). Your users can benefit from encrypted communication with very little operational overhead or administrative complexity.
>
>Until now, you had to handle the termination process within each EC2 instance. This added to the load on the instance and also required you to install an X.509 certificate on each instance. With this new release, you can simply upload the certificates to your AWS account and we’ll take care of getting them distributed to the load balancers.

A media company is evaluating the possibility of moving its systems to the AWS Cloud. The company needs at least 10 TB of storage with the maximum possible I/O performance for video processing, 300 TB of very durable storage for storing media content, and 900 TB of storage to meet requirements for archival media that is not in use anymore.  
Which set of services should a solutions architect recommend to meet these requirements?

- A. Amazon EBS for maximum performance, Amazon S3 for durable data storage, and Amazon S3 Glacier for archival storage
- B. Amazon EBS for maximum performance, Amazon EFS for durable data storage, and Amazon S3 Glacier for archival storage
- C. Amazon EC2 instance store for maximum performance, Amazon EFS for durable data storage, and Amazon S3 for archival storage
- D. Amazon EC2 instance store for maximum performance, Amazon S3 for durable data storage, and Amazon S3 Glacier for archival storage

instance store cannot be durable
THE CORRECT ANSWER IS A. The biggest Instance Store Storage Optimized option (is4gen.8xlarge) has a capacity of only 3TB. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-store-volumes.html#instance-store-vol-so

The correct Answer is A : Amazon EC2 instance store (Instance Store) is usually not the best choice because the storage it provides is temporary and tied to the life cycle of the instance. When an instance is stopped or terminated, data on the instance store is lost. In this scenario, the company's requirements were to have the maximum possible I/O performance and required durable data storage. Therefore, using Amazon EC2 Instance Store does not meet these requirements because it lacks durability. In contrast, Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store) provides persistent regional block storage and can meet the needs of high-performance I/O. Therefore, the answer should include Amazon EBS, not Amazon EC2 instance storage.

A company wants to move its application to a serverless solution. The serverless solution needs to analyze existing and new data by using SL. The company stores the data in an Amazon S3 bucket. The data requires encryption and must be replicated to a different AWS Region.  
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?

SL means: Supervised learning, 监督式机器学习

- A. Create a new S3 bucket. Load the data into the new S3 bucket. Use S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR) to replicate encrypted objects to an S3 bucket in another Region. Use server-side encryption with AWS KMS multi-Region kays (SSE-KMS). Use Amazon Athena to query the data.
- B. Create a new S3 bucket. Load the data into the new S3 bucket. Use S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR) to replicate encrypted objects to an S3 bucket in another Region. Use server-side encryption with AWS KMS multi-Region keys (SSE-KMS). Use Amazon RDS to query the data.
- C. Load the data into the existing S3 bucket. Use S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR) to replicate encrypted objects to an S3 bucket in another Region. Use server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). Use Amazon Athena to query the data.
- D. Load the data into the existing S3 bucket. Use S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR) to replicate encrypted objects to an S3 bucket in another Region. Use server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). Use Amazon RDS to query the data.

SSE-KMS vs SSE-S3 - The last seems to have less overhead (as the keys are automatically generated by S3 and applied on data at upload, and don't require further actions. KMS provides more flexibility, but in turn involves a different service, which finally is more "complex" than just managing one (S3). So A and B are excluded. If you are in doubt, you are having 2 buckets in A and B, while just keeping one in C and D.
https://s3browser.com/server-side-encryption-types.aspx
Decide between C and D is deciding on Athena or RDS. RDS is a relational db, and we have documents on S3, which is the use case for Athena. Athena is also serverless, which eliminates the need of controlling the underlying infrastructure and capacity. So

A company runs workloads on AWS. The company needs to connect to a service from an external provider. The service is hosted in the provider's VPC. According to the company’s security team, the connectivity must be private and must be restricted to the target service. The connection must be initiated only from the company’s VPC.  
Which solution will mast these requirements?

- A. Create a VPC peering connection between the company's VPC and the provider's VPC. Update the route table to connect to the target service.
- B. Ask the provider to create a virtual private gateway in its VPC. Use AWS PrivateLink to connect to the target service.
- C. Create a NAT gateway in a public subnet of the company’s VPUpdate the route table to connect to the target service.
- D. Ask the provider to create a VPC endpoint for the target service. Use AWS PrivateLink to connect to the target service.

B

**AWS PrivateLink provides private connectivity between VPCs, AWS services, and your on-premises networks, without exposing your traffic to the public internet**. AWS PrivateLink makes it easy to connect services across different accounts and VPCs to significantly simplify your network architecture. Interface **VPC endpoints**, powered by AWS PrivateLink, connect you to services hosted by AWS Partners and supported solutions available in AWS Marketplace. https://aws.amazon.com/privatelink/

By asking the provider to create a VPC endpoint for the target service, the company can use AWS PrivateLink to connect to the target service. This enables the company to access the service privately and securely over an Amazon VPC endpoint, without requiring a NAT gateway, VPN, or AWS Direct Connect. Additionally, this will restrict the connectivity only to the target service, as required by the company's security team.

Option A VPC peering connection may not meet security requirement as it can allow communication between all resources in both VPCs.
Option B, asking the provider to create a virtual private gateway in its VPC and use AWS PrivateLink to connect to the target service is not the optimal solution because it may require the provider to make changes and also you may face security issues.
Option C, creating a NAT gateway in a public subnet of the company’s VPC can expose the target service to the internet, which would not meet the security requirements.

A company uses AWS Organizations to create dedicated AWS accounts for each business unit to manage each business unit's account independently upon request. The root email recipient missed a notification that was sent to the root user email address of one account. The company wants to ensure that all future notifications are not missed. Future notifications must be limited to account administrators.  
Which solution will meet these requirements?

- A. Configure the company’s email server to forward notification email messages that are sent to the AWS account root user email address to all users in the organization.
- B. Configure all AWS account root user email addresses as distribution lists that go to a few administrators who can respond to alerts. Configure AWS account alternate contacts in the AWS Organizations console or programmatically.
- C. Configure all AWS account root user email messages to be sent to one administrator who is responsible for monitoring alerts and forwarding those alerts to the appropriate groups.
- D. Configure all existing AWS accounts and all newly created accounts to use the same root user email address. Configure AWS account alternate contacts in the AWS Organizations console or programmatically.

Option B ensures that all future notifications are not missed by configuring the AWS account root user email addresses as distribution lists that are monitored by a few administrators. By setting up alternate contacts in the AWS Organizations console or programmatically, the notifications can be sent to the appropriate administrators responsible for monitoring and responding to alerts. This solution allows for centralized management of notifications and ensures they are limited to account administrators.

A. Floods all users with notifications, lacks granularity.
C. Manual forwarding introduces delays, centralizes responsibility.
D. No flexibility for specific account administrators, limits customization.

A solutions architect needs to help a company optimize the cost of running an application on AWS. The application will use Amazon EC2 instances, AWS Fargate, and AWS Lambda for compute within the architecture.  
The EC2 instances will run the data ingestion layer of the application. EC2 usage will be **sporadic** and unpredictable. Workloads that run on EC2 instances can be interrupted at any time. The application front end will run on [[Fargate]] and Lambda will serve the API layer. The front-end utilization and API layer utilization will be predictable over the course of the next year.  
Which combination of purchasing options will provide the MOST cost-effective solution for hosting this application? (Choose two.)

- A. Use Spot Instances for the data ingestion layer
- B. Use On-Demand Instances for the data ingestion layer
- C. Purchase a ==1-year Compute Savings Plan for the front end and API layer.==  ( @Actionable )
- D. Purchase 1-year All Upfront Reserved instances for the data ingestion layer.
- E. Purchase a 1-year EC2 instance Savings Plan for the front end and API layer.

A (unpredictable-> demand / spot) (can be interupted -> spot)
C

**Sporadic** means something that happens **occasionally** or **irregularly**, without a consistent pattern or frequency. For example, "sporadic rain" refers to rain that occurs infrequently or unexpectedly.

Spot Instances provide the greatest savings for flexible, interruptible EC2 workloads like data ingestion.
Savings Plans offer significant discounts for predictable usage like the front end and API layer.

[[AWS saving plan]]

AWS Spot Instances can provide savings of **up to 90%** compared to On-Demand EC2 instances. (@higher than saving plan 72%, so spot is most economic friendly)

Content is served over HTTPS through an API server running on an Amazon EC2 instance behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). The company wants the portal to provide this content to its users across the world as quickly as possible.
How should a solutions architect design the application to ensure the LEAST amount of latency for all users?

A. Deploy the application stack in a single AWS Region. Use [[Amazon CloudFront]] to serve all static and dynamic content by specifying the ALB
as an origin.
B. Deploy the application stack in two AWS Regions. Use an Amazon Route 53 latency routing policy to serve all content from the ALB in the
closest Region.
C. Deploy the application stack in a single AWS Region. Use Amazon CloudFront to serve the static content. Serve the dynamic content
directly from the ALB.
D. Deploy the application stack in two AWS Regions. Use an Amazon Route 53 geolocation routing policy to serve all content from the ALB in
the closest Region.

A company recently started using Amazon Aurora as the data store for its global ecommerce application. When large reports are run, developers report that the ecommerce application is performing poorly. After reviewing metrics in Amazon CloudWatch, a solutions architect finds that the ReadIOPS and CPUUtilizalion metrics are spiking when monthly reports run.
What is the MOST cost-effective solution?

A. Migrate the monthly reporting to Amazon Redshift.
B. Migrate the monthly reporting to an Aurora Replica.
C. Migrate the Aurora database to a larger instance class.
D. Increase the Provisioned IOPS on the Aurora instance.

Option A: Migrating the monthly reporting to [[Amazon Redshift]] may not be cost-effective because it involves creating a new data store and
potentially significant data migration and ETL costs

Option B: Migrating the monthly reporting to an Aurora Replica may be the most cost-effective solution because it involves creating a read-only
copy of the database that can be used specifically for running large reports without impacting the performance of the primary database. This
solution allows the company to scale the read capacity of the database without incurring additional hardware or I/O costs.

The analytics software, the web server that provides PHP, and the database server are all hosted on the EC2 instance. The application is showing signs of performance degradation during busy times and is presenting 5xx errors. The company needs to make the application scale seamlessly.
Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?

A. Migrate the database to an Amazon RDS for MySQL DB instance. Create an AMI of the web application. Use the AMI to launch a second EC2 On-Demand Instance. Use an Application Load Balancer to distribute the load to each EC2 instance.
B. Migrate the database to an Amazon RDS for MySQL DB instance. Create an AMI of the web application. Use the AMI to launch a second EC2 On-Demand Instance. Use Amazon Route 53 weighted routing to distribute the load across the two EC2 instances.
C. Migrate the database to an Amazon Aurora MySQL DB instance. Create an AWS Lambda function to stop the EC2 instance and change the
instance type. Create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm to invoke the Lambda function when CPU utilization surpasses 75%.
D. Migrate the database to an Amazon Aurora MySQL DB instance. Create an AMI of the web application. Apply the AMI to a launch template. Create an Auto Scaling group with the launch template Configure the launch template to use a Spot Fleet. Attach an Application Load Balancer
to the Auto Scaling group.

scale seamlessly => connot just add second EC2 / cannot just stop running EC2 then change its type then restart it

X: I wouldn't run my website on spot instances. Spot instances might be terminated at any time, and since I need to run analytics application it's not
an option for me. And using route 53 for load balancing of 2 instances is an overkill. I go with A.
R: It is spot fleet - not spot instances. They can include On-Demand instances and can also maintain the target capacity automatically.
A Spot Fleet is a set of Spot Instances and optionally On-Demand Instances that is launched based on criteria that you specify. The Spot Fleet
selects the Spot capacity pools that meet your needs and launches Spot Instances to meet the target capacity for the fleet. By default, Spot
Fleets are set to maintain target capacity by launching replacement instances after Spot Instances in the fleet are terminated.

A company has a data ingestion workflow that includes the following components: An Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic that receives notifications about new data deliveries An AWS Lambda function that processes and stores the data The ingestion workflow occasionally fails because of network connectivity issues. When failure occurs, the corresponding data is not ingested unless the company manually reruns the job.
What should a solutions architect do to ensure that all notifications are eventually processed?

A. Configure the Lambda function for deployment across multiple Availability Zones.
B. Modify the Lambda function's configuration to increase the CPU and memory allocations for the function.
C. Configure the SNS topic’s retry strategy to increase both the number of retries and the wait time between retries.
D. Configure an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue as the on-failure destination. Modify the Lambda function to process
messages in the queue.

SNS retry attempt is limited to a certain times, atfer reach out this limitation, SNS will discard this message

A company has a service that produces event data. The company wants to use AWS to process the event data as it is received. The data is written in a specific order that must be maintained throughout processing. The company wants to implement a solution that minimizes operational overhead.
How should a solutions architect accomplish this?

A. Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) FIFO queue to hold messages. Set up an AWS Lambda function to process messages from the queue.
B. Create an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic to deliver notifications containing payloads to process. Configure an AWS Lambda function as a subscriber.
C. Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) standard queue to hold messages. Set up an AWS Lambda function to process
messages from the queue independently.

A company is migrating an application from on-premises servers to Amazon EC2 instances. As part of the migration design requirements, a solutions architect must implement infrastructure metric alarms. The company does not need to take action if CPU utilization increases to more than 50% for a short burst of time. However, if the CPU utilization ncreases to more than 50% and read IOPS on the disk are high at the same time, the company needs to act as soon as possible. The solutions architect also must reduce false alarms.
What should the solutions architect do to meet these requirements?

A. Create Amazon CloudWatch composite alarms where possible.
B. Create Amazon CloudWatch dashboards to visualize the metrics and react to issues quickly.
C. Create Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics canaries to monitor the application and raise an alarm.
D. Create single Amazon CloudWatch metric alarms with multiple metric thresholds where possible.

use composite alarms to reduce alarm noise
By creating composite alarms in CloudWatch, the solutions architect can combine multiple metrics, such as CPU utilization and read IOPS, into a
single alarm. This allows the company to take action only when both conditions are met, reducing false alarms and focusing on meaningful alerts

CloudWatch Synthetics canaries is useful for actively monitoring the application's behavior and availability.

A company wants to migrate its on-premises data center to AWS. According to the company's compliance requirements, the company can use only the ap-northeast-3 Region. Company administrators are not permitted to connect VPCs to the internet.
Which solutions will meet these requirements? (Choose two.)

A. Use [[AWS Control Tower]] to implement data residency guardrails to deny internet access and deny access to all AWS Regions except ap-
northeast-3.
https://aws.amazon.com/jp/about-aws/whats-new/2021/11/aws-control-tower-controls-data-residency-requirements/

B. Use rules in[[ AWS WAF]] to prevent internet access. Deny access to all AWS Regions except ap-northeast-3 in the AWS account settings.

C. Use AWS Organizations to configure service control policies (SCPS) that prevent VPCs from gaining internet access. Deny access to all AWS Regions except ap-northeast-3.
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps_examples_vpc.html#example_vpc_2

D. Create an outbound rule for the [[Network ACL]] in each VPC to deny all traffic from 0.0.0.0/0. Create an IAM policy for each user to prevent the use of any AWS Region other than ap-northeast-3.

E. Use AWS Config to activate managed rules to detect and alert for internet gateways and to detect and alert for new resources deployed
outside of ap-northeast-3.

A company uses a three-tier web application to provide training to new employees. The application is accessed for only 12 hours every day. The company is using an Amazon RDS for MySQL DB instance to store   information and wants to minimize costs. 
What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?

A. Configure an IAM policy for AWS Systems Manager Session Manager. Create an IAM role for the policy. Update the trust relationship of the role. Set up automatic start and stop for the DB instance.

~~B.~~ Create an Amazon ElastiCache for Redis cache cluster that gives users the ability to access the data from the cache when the DB instance
is stopped. Invalidate the cache after the DB instance is started.

C. Launch an Amazon EC2 instance. Create an IAM role that grants access to Amazon RDS. Attach the role to the EC2 instance. Configure a cron job to start and stop the EC2 instance on the desired schedule.

D. Create AWS Lambda functions to start and stop the DB instance. Create Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) scheduled rules to invoke the Lambda functions. Configure the Lambda functions as event targets for the rules.

### 153
A company sells ringtones created from clips of popular songs. The files containing the ringtones are stored in Amazon S3 Standard and are at least 128 KB in size. The company has millions of files, but downloads are infrequent for ringtones older than 90 days. The company needs to save money on storage while keeping the most accessed files readily available for its users.
Which action should the company take to meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?

A. Configure S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) storage for the initial storage tier of the objects.
B. Move the files to S3 Intelligent-Tiering and configure it to move objects to a less expensive storage tier after 90 days.
C. Configure S3 inventory to manage objects and move them to S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-1A) after 90 days.
D. Implement an S3 Lifecycle policy that moves the objects from S3 Standard to S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-1A) after 90 days.

D

why B wrong
- S3 Intelligent-Tiering is a great choice for **unpredictable access patterns**, but the **company’s pattern is predictable** (older files are less accessed after 90 days).
- **Lifecycle policies** are **more cost-effective** for predictable scenarios.

### 154
A company needs to save the results from a medical trial to an Amazon S3 repository. The repository must allow a few scientists to add new files and must restrict all other users to read-only access. No users can have the ability to modify or delete any files in the repository. The company must keep every file in the repository for a minimum of 1 year after its creation date.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A. Use S3 Object Lock in governance mode with a legal hold of 1 year.
B. Use S3 Object Lock in compliance mode with a retention period of 365 days.
C. Use an IAM role to restrict all users from deleting or changing objects in the S3 bucket. Use an S3 bucket policy to only allow the IAM role.
D. Configure the S3 bucket to invoke an AWS Lambda function every time an object is added. Configure the function to track the hash of the saved object so that modified objects can be marked accordingly.

B

Amazon S3 Object Lock
1. Governance mode - Only users with special permissions can overwrite, delete, or alter object ock settings
2. Compliance mode - No user, including the root user in an AWS account, can overwrite, delete, or alter object lock settings

A company stores data in an Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster. The company must store all the data for 5 years and must delete all the data after 5 years. The company also must indefinitely keep audit logs of actions that are performed within the database. Currently, the company has automated backups configured for Aurora.
Which combination of steps should a solutions architect take to meet these requirements? (Choose two.)
A. Take a manual snapshot of the DB cluster.
B. Create a lifecycle policy for the automated backups.
C. Configure automated backup retention for 5 years.
D. Configure an Amazon CloudWatch Logs export for the DB cluster.
E. Use AWS Backup to take the backups and to keep the backups for 5 years.

(@ These backups will be **retained for 5 years** before they are automatically deleted based on the **retention polic**)
When Will Old Backups Disappear?
- Old backups will **disappear automatically** after the **retention period ends** (in this case, **5 years**).
    - **Example**: If a backup was taken on **October 27, 2024**, it will **expire and be deleted** on **October 27, 2029**.
- AWS Backup handles the **deletion** automatically according to the **retention policy** you set in the backup plan.

DE

A - Manual task that can be automated, so why make life difficult?
B - The maximum retention period is 35 days, so would not help
C - The maximum retention period is 35 days, so would not help
D - Only option that deals with logs, so makes sense
E - Partially manual but only option that achieves the 5 year goal

### 159
A company is running a publicly accessible serverless application that uses [[Amazon API Gateway]] and AWS Lambda. The application’s traffic recently spiked due to fraudulent requests from botnets. 
Which steps should a solutions architect take to block requests from unauthorized users? (Choose two.)
A. Create a usage plan with an API key that is shared with genuine users only.
B. Integrate logic within the Lambda function to ignore the requests from fraudulent IP addresses.
C. Implement an AWS WAF rule to target malicious requests and trigger actions to filter them out.
D. Convert the existing public API to a private API. Update the DNS records to redirect users to the new API endpoint.
E. Create an IAM role for each user attempting to access the API. A user will assume the role when making the API call.

A C 
A 
- API Gateway can **generate and manage API keys** to control **who can access the API**.
- An **API key** is a unique string that identifies authorized users and helps **throttle or rate-limit** their requests via a **usage plan**.

B) no possible for a  publicly accessible application to handle dynamic IP of bots
C) WAF has bot identification and remedial tools, so it's CORRECT.

**Why option E is problematic**:
- **IAM roles** are designed for managing **permissions** between AWS services or users within AWS, not for managing public access to APIs.
- **End-users (e.g., mobile app or web app users)** don’t typically assume IAM roles when making API calls. Instead, API Gateway manages public access with **API keys, Cognito, or IAM policies**.
- Implementing this approach would **require complex user management** and is **impractical** for large public-facing applications.
