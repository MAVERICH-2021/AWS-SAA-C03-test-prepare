A solutions architect is designing a VPC with public and private subnets. The VPC and subnets use IPv4 CIDR blocks. There is one public subnet and one private subnet in each of three Availability Zones (AZs) for high availability. An internet gateway is used to provide internet access for the public subnets. The private subnets require access to the internet to allow Amazon EC2 instances to download software updates.  
What should the solutions architect do to enable Internet access for the private subnets?

- A. Create three NAT gateways, one for each public subnet in each AZ. Create a private route table for each AZ that forwards non-VPC traffic to the NAT gateway in its AZ.
- B. Create three NAT instances, one for each private subnet in each AZ. Create a private route table for each AZ that forwards non-VPC traffic to the NAT instance in its AZ.
- C. Create a second internet gateway on one of the private subnets. Update the route table for the private subnets that forward non-VPC traffic to the private internet gateway.
- D. Create an egress-only internet gateway on one of the public subnets. Update the route table for the private subnets that forward non-VPC traffic to the egress-only Internet gateway.

A company wants to migrate an on-premises data center to AWS. The data center hosts an SFTP server that stores its data on an NFS-based file system. The server holds 200 GB of data that needs to be transferred. The server must be hosted on an Amazon EC2 instance that uses an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system.  
Which combination of steps should a solutions architect take to automate this task? (Choose two.)

- A. Launch the EC2 instance into the same Availability Zone as the EFS file system.
- B. Install an AWS DataSync agent in the on-premises data center.
- C. Create a secondary Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume on the EC2 instance for the data.
- D. Manually use an operating system copy command to push the data to the EC2 instance.
- E. Use AWS DataSync to create a suitable location configuration for the on-premises SFTP server.


To automate the process of transferring the data from the on-premises SFTP server to an EC2 instance with an EFS file system, you can use AWS DataSync. AWS DataSync is a fully managed data transfer service that simplifies, automates, and accelerates transferring data between on-premises storage systems and Amazon S3, Amazon EFS, or Amazon FSx for Windows File Server.

To use AWS DataSync for this task, you should first install an AWS DataSync agent in the on-premises data center. This agent is a lightweight software application that you install on your on-premises data source. The agent communicates with the AWS DataSync service to transfer data between the data source and target locations.

A company has an AWS Glue extract, transform, and load (ETL) job that runs every day at the same time. The job processes XML data that is in an Amazon S3 bucket. New data is added to the S3 bucket every day. A solutions architect notices that AWS Glue is processing all the data during each run.  
What should the solutions architect do to prevent AWS Glue from reprocessing old data?

- A. Edit the job to use job bookmarks.
- B. Edit the job to delete data after the data is processed.
- C. Edit the job by setting the NumberOfWorkers field to 1.
- D. Use a FindMatches machine learning (ML) transform.

A
This is the purpose of bookmarks: "AWS Glue tracks data that has already been processed during a previous run of an ETL job by persisting state information from the job run. This persisted state information is called a job bookmark

### 107
A bicycle sharing company is developing a multi-tier architecture to track the location of its bicycles during peak operating hours. The company wants to use these data points in its existing analytics platform. A solutions architect must determine the most viable multi-tier option to support this architecture. The data points must be accessible from the REST API.  
Which action meets these requirements for storing and retrieving location data?

- A. Use Amazon Athena with Amazon S3.
- B. Use Amazon API Gateway with AWS Lambda.
- C. Use Amazon QuickSight with Amazon Redshift.
- D. Use Amazon API Gateway with Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics.

The correct answer is:

**D. Use Amazon API Gateway with Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics.**

Explanation:
Let’s analyze the requirements:

1. **Track real-time bicycle locations**: This suggests that the company needs a solution capable of ingesting, processing, and analyzing streaming data quickly.
2. **Multi-tier architecture**: This involves multiple layers, such as ingestion, processing, storage, and analytics.
3. **Data should be accessible from a REST API**: This means the solution should expose endpoints that allow access to data in near real-time for external applications or users.
4. **Integration with analytics platform**: Data points need to be continuously sent to an analytics system, indicating a preference for a service that supports streaming data with minimal latency.

**Option Analysis:**

- **A. Use Amazon Athena with Amazon S3**:  
   - **Athena** is a query engine used to analyze data stored in **S3**.  
   - This is not ideal for tracking real-time locations, as it is more suited for querying static, historical data.
   - It doesn’t support **real-time analytics or data streaming** directly.

- **B. Use Amazon API Gateway with AWS Lambda**:  
   - API Gateway with Lambda can provide a REST API interface, but Lambda functions are better suited for processing **event-based requests** rather than continuously streaming real-time data.
   - It wouldn’t handle high-frequency, real-time data ingestion and processing as efficiently as a **streaming solution** like Kinesis.

- **C. Use Amazon QuickSight with Amazon Redshift**:  
   - Redshift is a **data warehouse**, suitable for querying large datasets but **not designed for real-time data ingestion**.  
   - QuickSight is used for building **dashboards and visualizations**, not for tracking real-time locations.

- **D. Use Amazon API Gateway with Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics**:  
   - **API Gateway** can expose REST API endpoints for retrieving location data.
   - **Kinesis Data Analytics** can process the **real-time stream of location data** as it is ingested through **Kinesis Data Streams** or **Kinesis Firehose**.
   - This combination allows the company to perform **real-time analytics** and expose relevant insights through the REST API, which fits the requirements perfectly.

### 108

A company has an automobile sales website that stores its listings in a database on Amazon RDS. When an automobile is sold, the listing needs to be removed from the website and the data must be sent to multiple target systems.  
Which design should a solutions architect recommend?

- A. Create an AWS Lambda function triggered when the database on Amazon RDS is updated to send the information to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue for the targets to consume.
- B. Create an AWS Lambda function triggered when the database on Amazon RDS is updated to send the information to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) FIFO queue for the targets to consume.
- C. Subscribe to an RDS event notification and send an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue fanned out to multiple Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topics. Use AWS Lambda functions to update the targets.
- D. Subscribe to an RDS event notification and send an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic fanned out to multiple Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queues. Use AWS Lambda functions to update the targets.


The correct answer is:  A

---
**Explanation:**

The problem describes a **real-time trigger** system where:
1. **Database updates (listing removal) should trigger actions**.
2. **Multiple target systems** must receive the data.

 B
- A **FIFO queue** enforces strict ordering, which adds unnecessary complexity unless order is a strict requirement (not mentioned here).
- **Standard SQS** queues are typically preferred for decoupling with multiple consumers.

- **C. 
- This introduces **unnecessary complexity** by adding multiple SNS topics.  
- The direct use of SQS queues for each target is simpler and more appropriate.

- **D. 
- This approach relies on **RDS event notifications**, but these notifications are **limited** and may not trigger on all types of data changes.
- The **Lambda + SQS** design in Option A is a more **reliable and straightforward** way to trigger actions based on **data changes**.


### 109
A company needs to store data in Amazon S3 and must prevent the data from being changed. The company wants new objects that are uploaded to Amazon S3 to remain unchangeable for a nonspecific amount of time until the company decides to modify the objects. Only specific users in the company's AWS account can have the ability 10 delete the objects.  
What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?

- A. Create an S3 Glacier vault. Apply a write-once, read-many (WORM) vault lock policy to the objects.
- B. Create an S3 bucket with S3 Object Lock enabled. Enable versioning. Set a retention period of 100 years. Use governance mode as the S3 bucket’s default retention mode for new objects.
- C. Create an S3 bucket. Use AWS CloudTrail to track any S3 API events that modify the objects. Upon notification, restore the modified objects from any backup versions that the company has.
- D. Create an S3 bucket with S3 Object Lock enabled. Enable versioning. Add a legal hold to the objects. Add the s3:PutObjectLegalHold permission to the IAM policies of users who need to delete the objects.

retention period:
the length of time that information or records are kept, regardless of their format.

"The Object Lock legal hold operation enables you to place a legal hold on an object version. Like setting a retention period, a legal hold prevents an object version from being overwritten or deleted. However, a legal hold doesn't have an associated retention period and remains in effect until removed."

A social media company allows users to upload images to its website. The website runs on Amazon EC2 instances. During upload requests, the website resizes the images to a standard size and stores the resized images in Amazon S3. Users are experiencing slow upload requests to the website.  
The company needs to reduce coupling within the application and improve website performance. A solutions architect must design the most operationally efficient process for image uploads.  
Which combination of actions should the solutions architect take to meet these requirements? (Choose two.)

- A. Configure the application to upload images to S3 Glacier.
- B. Configure the web server to upload the original images to Amazon S3.
- C. Configure the application to upload images directly from each user's browser to Amazon S3 through the use of a presigned URL
- D. Configure S3 Event Notifications to invoke an AWS Lambda function when an image is uploaded. Use the function to resize the image.
- E. Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that invokes an AWS Lambda function on a schedule to resize uploaded images.


A user who does not have AWS credentials to upload a file can use a presigned URL to perform the upload. https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/s3-presigned-urls.html

Option B, Configuring the webserver to upload the original images to Amazon S3, is not a recommended solution as it would not reduce coupling within the application or improve performance.

A company hosts a containerized web application on a fleet of on-premises servers that process incoming requests. The number of requests is growing quickly. The on-premises servers cannot handle the increased number of requests. The company wants to move the application to AWS with minimum code changes and minimum development effort.  
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?

- A. Use AWS Fargate on Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) to run the containerized web application with Service Auto Scaling. Use an Application Load Balancer to distribute the incoming requests.
- B. Use two Amazon EC2 instances to host the containerized web application. Use an Application Load Balancer to distribute the incoming requests.
- C. Use AWS Lambda with a new code that uses one of the supported languages. Create multiple Lambda functions to support the load. Use Amazon API Gateway as an entry point to the Lambda functions.
- D. Use a high performance computing (HPC) solution such as AWS ParallelCluster to establish an HPC cluster that can process the incoming requests at the appropriate scale.

A company uses 50 TB of data for reporting. The company wants to move this data from on premises to AWS. A custom application in the company’s data center runs a weekly data transformation job. The company plans to pause the application until the data transfer is complete and needs to begin the transfer process as soon as possible.  
The data center does not have any available network bandwidth for additional workloads. A solutions architect must transfer the data and must configure the transformation job to continue to run in the AWS Cloud.  
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?

- A. Use AWS DataSync to move the data. Create a custom transformation job by using AWS Glue.
- B. Order an AWS Snowcone device to move the data. Deploy the transformation application to the device.
- C. Order an AWS Snowball Edge Storage Optimized device. Copy the data to the device. Create a custom transformation job by using AWS Glue.
- D. Order an AWS Snowball Edge Storage Optimized device that includes Amazon EC2 compute. Copy the data to the device. Create a new EC2 instance on AWS to run the transformation application.

AWS Snowcone
1. Deploy ultra-portable data transfer and edge computing devices anywhere
2. Collect and process data, transfer with AWS DataSync, or ship the device with data to AWS for offline transfer.


A. Use AWS DataSync to move the data. Create a custom transformation job by using AWS Glue. - No BW available for DataSync, so "asap" will be weeks/months (?)
B. Order an AWS Snowcone device to move the data. Deploy the transformation application to the device. - ==Snowcone will just store 14T==B (SSD configuration).
**C**. Order an AWS Snowball Edge Storage Optimized device. Copy the data to the device. Create a custom transformation job by using AWS Glue. - SnowBall can store 80TB (ok), takes around 1 week to move the device (faster than A), and AWS Glue allows to do ETL jobs. This is the answer.
D. Order an AWS Snowball Edge Storage Optimized device that includes Amazon EC2 compute. Copy the data to the device. Create a new EC2 instance on AWS to run the transformation application. - Same as C, but the ETL job requires the deployment/configuration/maintenance of an EC2 instance, while Glue is serverless. This means D has more operational overhead than C.

A global company is using Amazon API Gateway to design REST APIs for its loyalty club users in the us-east-1 Region and the ap-southeast-2 Region. A solutions architect must design a solution to protect these API Gateway managed REST APIs across multiple accounts from SQL injection and cross-site scripting attacks.  
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST amount of administrative effort?

- A. Set up AWS WAF in both Regions. Associate Regional web ACLs with an API stage.
- B. Set up AWS Firewall Manager in both Regions. Centrally configure AWS WAF rules.
- C. Set up AWS Shield in bath Regions. Associate Regional web ACLs with an API stage.
- D. Set up AWS Shield in one of the Regions. Associate Regional web ACLs with an API stage.
 **Option A: Set up AWS WAF in both Regions. Associate Regional web ACLs with an API stage.**

- **AWS WAF** is a **web application firewall** that protects web applications from security threats, including SQL injection and XSS.
- You need to configure **Regional web ACLs** because API Gateway is a **Regional service**.
- This solution aligns well with the requirement to protect REST APIs in **multiple regions** (us-east-1 and ap-southeast-2).
- Associating **web ACLs with API Gateway stages** ensures fine-grained protection at the API level.
- **Least administrative effort**: WAF rules are easy to set up, and AWS WAF has built-in managed rules for SQL injection and XSS attacks.

Thus, **this is the correct and most straightforward solution**.

 **Option B: Set up AWS Firewall Manager in both Regions. Centrally configure AWS WAF rules.**

- **AWS Firewall Manager** helps centrally manage firewall rules across multiple accounts and regions.
- While it simplifies rule management, it is more relevant for managing multiple security policies across **multiple AWS accounts** and services (like WAF, Shield, and Security Groups).
- For this scenario, the use of Firewall Manager introduces **unnecessary overhead**, as the primary goal is just API-level protection within a specific scope (multiple regions, not complex multi-account setups).

A company has implemented a self-managed DNS solution on three Amazon EC2 instances behind a Network Load Balancer (NLB) in the us-west-2 Region. Most of the company's users are located in the United States and Europe. The company wants to improve the performance and availability of the solution. The company launches and configures three EC2 instances in the eu-west-1 Region and adds the EC2 instances as targets for a new NLB.  
Which solution can the company use to route traffic to all the EC2 instances?

- A. Create an Amazon Route 53 geolocation routing policy to route requests to one of the two NLBs. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution. Use the Route 53 record as the distribution’s origin.
- B. Create a standard accelerator in AWS Global Accelerator. Create endpoint groups in us-west-2 and eu-west-1. Add the two NLBs as endpoints for the endpoint groups.
- C. Attach Elastic IP addresses to the six EC2 instances. Create an Amazon Route 53 geolocation routing policy to route requests to one of the six EC2 instances. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution. Use the Route 53 record as the distribution's origin.
- D. Replace the two NLBs with two Application Load Balancers (ALBs). Create an Amazon Route 53 latency routing policy to route requests to one of the two ALBs. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution. Use the Route 53 record as the distribution’s origin.

B is the correct one for self manage DNS If need to use Route53, ALB (layar 7 ) needs to be used as end points for 2 reginal x 3 EC2s, if it the case answer would be the option 4
Ans B - "AWS Global Accelerator improves the availability and performance of your applications for global users by routing traffic to the optimal endpoint based on performance and policies."


- **AWS Global Accelerator** provides **improved performance and availability** by directing users to the closest healthy endpoint (in this case, the Network Load Balancers in **us-west-2** and **eu-west-1**).
- Global Accelerator leverages **AWS’s global network**, which reduces latency and ensures traffic is routed through the most efficient paths.
- **Endpoint groups** in **Global Accelerator** allow the company to distribute traffic across NLBs in multiple regions, ensuring high availability.
- It also provides **failover capability**, sending traffic to the healthy region if one region becomes unavailable.

This solution aligns with the requirements to route traffic across multiple regions, while improving **performance** and **availability** for users in the US and Europe.

NLB 本身就是一个endPoint

the Domain Name System (DNS) uses TCP in addition to UDP: 
UDP is default: DNS uses UDP by default, but switches to TCP when UDP is unable to communicate. 

 **A. Route 53 geolocation routing policy + CloudFront distribution**

- **Geolocation routing** directs traffic based on the user’s location, but it does not consider **performance** or **availability** as effectively as Global Accelerator.
- CloudFront helps cache and distribute static content, but it doesn’t manage regional EC2 instances or load balancing directly.
- This approach doesn’t optimize real-time DNS performance for users in different regions as effectively as Global Accelerator.

 **C. Elastic IP addresses + Route 53 geolocation policy + CloudFront**

- Using **Elastic IPs for EC2 instances** directly is not scalable or reliable, as EC2 instances behind NLBs are more resilient.
- **Geolocation routing** won’t offer as dynamic and efficient routing as **Global Accelerator**.
- Again, CloudFront is useful for static content but does not enhance the performance of DNS-based traffic to EC2 instances.

 **D. Replace NLBs with ALBs + Route 53 latency routing policy + CloudFront**

- **Application Load Balancers (ALBs)** are optimized for HTTP/HTTPS traffic, but DNS services typically use **UDP or TCP**, which **NLBs** handle better.
- While **Route 53 latency routing** can help with performance, it lacks the **failover and traffic acceleration** capabilities that **Global Accelerator** offers.
- CloudFront isn't needed here since the focus is on optimizing DNS traffic, not delivering static content.

A company is running an online transaction processing (OLTP) workload on AWS. This workload uses an unencrypted Amazon RDS DB instance in a Multi-AZ deployment. Daily database snapshots are taken from this instance.  
What should a solutions architect do to ensure the database and snapshots are always encrypted moving forward?

- A. Encrypt a copy of the latest DB snapshot. Replace existing DB instance by restoring the encrypted snapshot.
- B. Create a new encrypted Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume and copy the snapshots to it. Enable encryption on the DB instance.
- C. Copy the snapshots and enable encryption using AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) Restore encrypted snapshot to an existing DB instance.
- D. Copy the snapshots to an Amazon S3 bucket that is encrypted using server-side encryption with AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) managed keys (SSE-KMS).

"You can enable encryption for an Amazon RDS DB instance when you create it, but not after it's created. However, you can add encryption to an unencrypted DB instance by creating a snapshot of your DB instance, and then creating an encrypted copy of that snapshot. You can then restore a DB instance from the encrypted snapshot to get an encrypted copy of your original DB instance."

- A. Create a new SSL certificate using AWS Certificate Manager (ACM). Install the ACM certificate on each instance.
- B. Create an Amazon S3 bucket Migrate the SSL certificate to the S3 bucket. Configure the EC2 instances to reference the bucket for SSL termination.
- C. Create another EC2 instance as a proxy server. Migrate the SSL certificate to the new instance and configure it to direct connections to the existing EC2 instances.
- D. Import the SSL certificate into AWS Certificate Manager (ACM). Create an Application Load Balancer with an HTTPS listener that uses the SSL certificate from ACM.

> **SSL termination** is the process of **decrypting incoming SSL/TLS traffic** at a load balancer, proxy server, or firewall, before passing it to backend servers in **plain text** (unencrypted).

D

This issue is solved by SSL offloading, i.e. by moving the SSL termination task to the ALB.

>You can now create a highly scalable, load-balanced web site using multiple Amazon EC2 instances, and you can easily arrange for the entire [HTTPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Secure) encryption and decryption process (generally known as SSL termination) to be handled by an [Elastic Load Balancer](http://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/). Your users can benefit from encrypted communication with very little operational overhead or administrative complexity.
>
>Until now, you had to handle the termination process within each EC2 instance. This added to the load on the instance and also required you to install an X.509 certificate on each instance. With this new release, you can simply upload the certificates to your AWS account and we’ll take care of getting them distributed to the load balancers.

A company has a highly dynamic batch processing job that uses many Amazon EC2 instances to complete it. The job is stateless in nature, can be started and stopped at any given time with no negative impact, and typically takes upwards of 60 minutes total to complete. The company has asked a solutions architect to design a scalable and cost-effective solution that meets the requirements of the job.  
What should the solutions architect recommend?

- A. Implement EC2 Spot Instances.
- B. Purchase EC2 Reserved Instances.
- C. Implement EC2 On-Demand Instances.
- D. Implement the processing on AWS Lambda. 

Cant be implemented on Lambda because the timeout for Lambda is 15mins and the Job takes 60minutes to complete

A company runs its two-tier ecommerce website on AWS. The web tier consists of a load balancer that sends traffic to Amazon EC2 instances. The database tier uses an Amazon RDS DB instance. The EC2 instances and the RDS DB instance should not be exposed to the public internet. The EC2 instances require internet access to complete payment processing of orders through a third-party web service. The application must be highly available.  
Which combination of configuration options will meet these requirements? (Choose two.)

- A. Use an Auto Scaling group to launch the EC2 instances in private subnets. Deploy an RDS Multi-AZ DB instance in private subnets.
- B. Configure a VPC with two private subnets and two NAT gateways across two Availability Zones. Deploy an Application Load Balancer in the private subnets.
- C. Use an Auto Scaling group to launch the EC2 instances in public subnets across two Availability Zones. Deploy an RDS Multi-AZ DB instance in private subnets.
- D. Configure a VPC with one public subnet, one private subnet, and two NAT gateways across two Availability Zones. Deploy an Application Load Balancer in the public subnet.

A solutions architect needs to implement a solution to reduce a company's storage costs. All the company's data is in the Amazon S3 Standard storage class. The company must keep all data for at least 25 years. Data from the most recent 2 years must be highly available and immediately retrievable.  
Which solution will meet these requirements?

- A. Set up an S3 Lifecycle policy to transition objects to S3 Glacier Deep Archive immediately.
- B. Set up an S3 Lifecycle policy to transition objects to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 2 years.
- C. Use S3 Intelligent-Tiering. Activate the archiving option to ensure that data is archived in S3 Glacier Deep Archive.
- D. Set up an S3 Lifecycle policy to transition objects to S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA) immediately and to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 2 years.

A media company is evaluating the possibility of moving its systems to the AWS Cloud. The company needs at least 10 TB of storage with the maximum possible I/O performance for video processing, 300 TB of very durable storage for storing media content, and 900 TB of storage to meet requirements for archival media that is not in use anymore.  
Which set of services should a solutions architect recommend to meet these requirements?

- A. Amazon EBS for maximum performance, Amazon S3 for durable data storage, and Amazon S3 Glacier for archival storage
- B. Amazon EBS for maximum performance, Amazon EFS for durable data storage, and Amazon S3 Glacier for archival storage
- C. Amazon EC2 instance store for maximum performance, Amazon EFS for durable data storage, and Amazon S3 for archival storage
- D. Amazon EC2 instance store for maximum performance, Amazon S3 for durable data storage, and Amazon S3 Glacier for archival storage

instance store cannot be durable
THE CORRECT ANSWER IS A. The biggest Instance Store Storage Optimized option (is4gen.8xlarge) has a capacity of only 3TB. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-store-volumes.html#instance-store-vol-so

The correct Answer is A : Amazon EC2 instance store (Instance Store) is usually not the best choice because the storage it provides is temporary and tied to the life cycle of the instance. When an instance is stopped or terminated, data on the instance store is lost. In this scenario, the company's requirements were to have the maximum possible I/O performance and required durable data storage. Therefore, using Amazon EC2 Instance Store does not meet these requirements because it lacks durability. In contrast, Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store) provides persistent regional block storage and can meet the needs of high-performance I/O. Therefore, the answer should include Amazon EBS, not Amazon EC2 instance storage.
