**AWS Outposts** enables running **AWS cloud services locally** at your on-premises data center or remote locations. It extends AWS infrastructure, services, APIs, and tools to provide **a hybrid cloud solution**. Here’s how it works:

### **How AWS Outposts Runs AWS Services Locally:**

1. **Outposts Rack (AWS Hardware Installed On-Premises):**
   - AWS provides **pre-configured racks** with the same compute and storage hardware used in AWS regions.
   - This hardware is **physically installed** at your data center or on-prem location.
   - It’s fully managed and monitored by AWS (hardware maintenance, software updates).

2. **Direct Connection to AWS Region:**
   - Outposts communicates with the nearest AWS region for **control plane operations** (e.g., provisioning, monitoring).
   - Some services rely on **local operations**, while others route management through the region.
   - Requires a **network connection** to AWS, typically over **Direct Connect** or **VPN**.

3. **Running AWS Services Locally on Outposts:**
   - You can deploy the following AWS services locally:
     - **EC2** for virtual machines.
     - **EBS** for local block storage.
     - **RDS** for managed databases.
     - **S3** for object storage (via S3 Outposts).
     - **EKS/ECS** for container orchestration.
   - These services run on **Outposts hardware**, ensuring **low-latency access** and **data residency** compliance.

4. **Unified Management:**
   - Managed via the **AWS Console**, **CLI**, or **API** just like in the cloud.
   - Use the same tools (CloudWatch, CloudFormation) for monitoring and automation.
   - **Data replication** and backups can be configured to sync with the main AWS region if needed.


### **Why Use AWS Outposts?**
- **Low Latency:** For workloads that require near-instant responses (e.g., factory automation, edge computing).
- **Data Residency:** When data must stay in a specific location for **compliance**.
- **Hybrid Applications:** Seamlessly extend your cloud-based applications to on-premises.

### **Summary:**  
AWS Outposts allows you to run AWS services **locally on-prem**, using AWS-provided hardware, but still leverages the AWS cloud for management. This offers the **same AWS experience** but with **local execution** for low-latency and compliance-sensitive workloads.
