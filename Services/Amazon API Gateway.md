Amazon API Gateway does not support UDP traffic.

- fully managed
- allows developers to manage APIs 
- acting as a front door for applications to access backend services such as AWS Lambda, EC2, or other HTTP endpoints.

### front door
Amazon API Gateway acts as a **programmable front door** that securely manages and routes external requests from clients (like web apps or mobile devices) to backend services, including AWS Lambda functions, EC2 instances, and other APIs. It handles tasks such as **authentication, request validation, rate limiting,** and **monitoring**, ensuring that APIs remain scalable and protected.
