# Fleet
A *fleet of Amazon EC2 instances* refers to a group of Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) virtual servers running on Amazon Web Services (AWS) that work together to support applications, handle tasks, or manage workloads. AWS EC2 fleets allow you to manage multiple instances across various configurations, types, and availability zones, optimizing costs and ensuring that enough resources are available to meet demand.

Here’s a breakdown of what an EC2 fleet offers:

### 1. **Diverse Instance Types**
   - You can mix different instance types, including general-purpose, compute-optimized, and memory-optimized instances.
   - Fleets support multiple generations and configurations (like the latest generation for cost-efficiency or older ones for specific needs).

### 2. **Scaling Across Availability Zones**
   - EC2 fleets allow deployment across multiple AWS regions or availability zones, increasing reliability and fault tolerance by reducing the impact of any single data center failure.

### 3. **Spot and On-Demand Instances**
   - Fleets can include *On-Demand* instances (charged at a fixed hourly rate) and *Spot Instances* (available at discounted rates when there’s unused capacity).
   - This mix helps manage costs: spot instances are cheaper but less reliable, so they are often used for non-critical or interruptible tasks, while On-Demand instances provide stability.

### 4. **Automatic Scaling and Flexibility**
   - EC2 fleets can scale up or down based on demand, managed either manually or automatically.
   - AWS can add or remove instances based on application needs, optimizing both performance and cost.

### 5. **Unified Management**
   - AWS allows management of the entire fleet as a single unit, simplifying resource handling, monitoring, and billing.

By using a fleet instead of single instances, organizations can balance cost, reliability, and performance, tailoring their resources to match their workload's demands. This setup is commonly used in high-availability applications, large-scale data processing, and dynamic web services.
