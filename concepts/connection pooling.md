Connection pooling is a technique used in applications that interact with a database or external service frequently. It involves creating and managing a pool, or collection, of pre-established connections to the database or service that can be reused by the application whenever needed. This approach reduces the overhead associated with repeatedly creating and closing connections, improving efficiency and performance.
